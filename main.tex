We present a systematic review of existing smart contract languages
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Smart contracts based on distributed ledgers combine two peculiar properties: anyone can freely create such contracts for the whole world to access, while each line of code might affect millions.
These contracts are successful in their own regard:
Ethereum, the largest platform for such contracts, has no X contract controlling a combined value of X million USD.
However, security incidents caused by software bugs has lead to severe losses as in the DAO, Parity (1 and 2), and others.
A majority of the current work concentrates on creating safer smart contracts.

This survey takes on the verification perspective of these efforts and presents a survey of current work.
