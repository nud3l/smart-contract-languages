@book{Wooldridge2009,
abstract = {This is the first textbook to be explicitly designed for use as a course text for an undergraduate/graduate course on multi-agent systems. Assuming only a basic understanding of computer science, this text provides an introduction to all the main issues in the theory and practice of intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. The companion Web Site includes sample exercises, lecture slidest and hyperlinks to software referred to in the book Introduces agents, explains what agents are, how they are constructed and how they can be made to co-operate effectively with one another in large-scale systems Introduces the main issues surrounding the design of intelligent agents Introduces a number of typical applications for agent technology Multiagent systems represent a new way of conceptualising and implementing distributed software. An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems is the first modern textbook on this important topic. It provides a comprehensive introduction to intelligent agents and multiagent systems. The book assumes no specialist knowledge. It introduces the idea of agents as software systems that can act autonomously, and leads the reader through a detailed discussion of: ways that agents can be built how agents can reach agreements the languages that agents can use to communicate with one-another co-operation and co-ordination in agent systems and the applications of agent technology. Designed and written specifically for undergraduates and computing professionals, the book is supported by extensive online teaching resources, including a complete set of lecture slides. Illustrated with many informal examples, and packed with more than 500 references, An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems is a must-read for students and practitioners of agent systems alike.},

abstract = {The commonly used hedge fund compensation model creates agency problems that systematically incentivize managers to gather assets at the cost of performance. Firms with successful first funds are able to raise follow–on funds at favorable terms and generate more fee income. Empirical results confirm this to be the dominant growth strategy among hedge fund firms. Investors respond to this by rewarding alpha–producing hedge fund firms with significantly more capital flow. Despite these nonlinear dynamics of the hedge fund compensation model, we show that the Berk and Green (2004) rational model of active management applies to the hedge fund industry.},

It adopts execution-verification isomorphism (EVI), an extension of Curry-Howard isomorphism (CHI), as its fundamental theoretical framework. The current version of FSPVM-E is constructed on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM) framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language Lolisa, which is a large subset of the Solidity programming language using generalized algebraic datatypes, and the corresponding formally verified interpreter of Lolisa, denoted as FEther. It supports the ERC20 standard and can automatically simultaneously symbolically execute the smart contract programs of Ethereum and verify their reliability and security properties using Hoare logic in Coq. In addition, this work, contributes to solving the problems of automation, inconsistency and reusability in higher-order logic theorem proving.},

abstract = {Trust is crucial in dynamic multi-agent systems where agents may frequently join and leave, and the structure of the society may often change. In these environments, it may be difficult for agents to form stable trust relationships necessary for confident interactions. Societies may break down when trust between agents is too low to motivate interactions. In such settings, agents should make decisions about who to interact with, given their degree of trust in the available partners. We propose a decision-theoretic model of trust decision making allows controls to be used, as well as trust, to increase confidence in initial interactions. We consider explicit incentives, monitoring and reputation as examples of such controls. We evaluate our approach within a simulated, highly-dynamic multiagent environment, and show how this model supports the making of delegation decisions when trust is low.},

@article{Juels2007,
abstract = {In this paper, we define and explore proofs of retrievability (PORs). A POR scheme enables an archive or back-up service (prover) to produce a concise proof that a user (verifier) can retrieve a target file F, that is, that the archive retains and reliably transmits file data sufficient for the user to recover F in its entirety. A POR may be viewed as a kind of cryptographic proof of knowledge (POK), but one specially designed to handle a large file (or bitstring) F. We explore POR protocols here in which the communication costs, number of memory accesses for the prover, and storage requirements of the user (verifier) are small parameters essentially independent of the length of F. In addition to proposing new, practical POR constructions, we explore implementation considerations and optimizations that bear on previously explored, related schemes. In a POR, unlike a POK, neither the prover nor the verifier need actually have knowledge of F. PORs give rise to a new and unusual security definition whose formulation is another contribution of our work. We view PORs as an important tool for semi-trusted online archives. Existing cryptographic techniques help users ensure the privacy and integrity of files they retrieve. It is also natural, however, for users to want to verify that archives do not delete or modify files prior to retrieval. The goal of a POR is to accomplish these checks without users having to download the files themselves. A POR can also provide quality-of-service guarantees, i.e., show that a file is retrievable within a certain time bound. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

@unpublished{Sompolinsky2018,
abstract = {In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto invented the basis for what would come to be known as blockchain technology. The core concept of this system is an open and anonymous network of nodes, or miners, which together maintain a public ledger of transactions. The ledger takes the form of a chain of blocks, the blockchain, where each block is a batch of new transactions collected from users. One primary problem with Satoshi's blockchain is its highly limited scalability. The security of Satoshi's longest chain rule, more generally known as the Bitcoin protocol, requires that all honest nodes be aware of each other's blocks in real time. To this end, the throughput is artificially suppressed so that each block fully propagates before the next one is created, and that no " orphan blocks " that fork the chain be created spontaneously. In this paper we present PHANTOM, a protocol for transaction confirmation that is secure under any throughput that the network can support. PHANTOM thus does not suffer from the security-scalability tradeoff which Satoshi's protocol suffers from. PHANTOM utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph of blocks, aka blockDAG, a generalization of Satoshi's chain which better suits a setup of fast or large blocks. PHANTOM uses a greedy algorithm on the blockDAG to distinguish between blocks mined properly by honest nodes and those mined by non-cooperating nodes that deviated from the DAG mining protocol. Using this distinction, PHANTOM provides a full order on the blockDAG in a way that is eventually agreed upon by all honest nodes.},

@article{Wu2018,
abstract = {The ongoing rapid development of the e-commercial and interest-base websites make it more pressing to evaluate objects' accurate quality before recommendation by employing an effective reputation system. The objects' quality are often calculated based on their historical information, such as selected records or rating scores, to help visitors to make decisions before watching, reading or buying. Usually high quality products obtain a higher average ratings than low quality products regardless of rating biases or errors. However many empirical cases demonstrate that consumers may be misled by rating scores added by unreliable users or deliberate tampering. In this case, users' reputation, i.e., the ability to rating trustily and precisely, make a big difference during the evaluating process. Thus, one of the main challenges in designing reputation systems is eliminating the effects of users' rating bias on the evaluation results. To give an objective evaluation of each user's reputation and uncover an object's intrinsic quality, we propose an iterative balance (IB) method to correct users' rating biases. Experiments on two online video-provided Web sites, namely MovieLens and Netflix datasets, show that the IB method is a highly self-consistent and robust algorithm and it can accurately quantify movies' actual quality and users' stability of rating. Compared with existing methods, the IB method has higher ability to find the "dark horses", i.e., not so popular yet good movies, in the Academy Awards.},

In this work, we present a novel consensus algorithm that circumvents this requirement by utilizing collectively-trusted subnetworks within the larger network. We show that the “trust” required of these subnetworks is in fact minimal and can be further reduced with principled choice of the member nodes. In addition, we show that minimal connectivity is required to maintain agreement throughout the whole network. The result is a low-latency consensus algorithm which still maintains robustness in the face of Byzantine failures. We present this algorithm in its embodiment in the Ripple Protocol. Contents},

abstract = {Motivation. Public ledger is a decentralized book keeping technology and is believed to have the potential to revolutionize many areas. Besides handling crypto-currency, public ledger can be used to tokenize arbitrary assets, and then support trading of these asset tokens in a decentralized manner. With public ledger based token trading system, users do not necessarily convert their assets to currencies, but can exchange assets directly. It also avoids unnecessary transportation as the asset only needs to be physically transferred to its last owner. Furthermore, utilization of the public ledger does not require that users have to trust each other in order to trade tokens safely. However, using decentralized public ledger for trading asset tokens raises serious privacy concerns. Because token ownership information is stored on the public ledger and disclosed to the public, anyone can uncover users trading activities and history. For a token based asset trading platform, all tokens are unique and transactions are usually two-ways or multi-ways. In response to these challenges, we propose ZeroTrade, a privacy respecting heterogeneous assets trading system that leverages various cryptography tools to conceal the exchange trace of asset tokens and takes advantage of public ledger for guaranteeing fairness of asset token exchange. Solution. ZeroTrade involves trusted hubs that are responsible for converting assets to tokens and back, where trusted means that hubs will generate/accept valid tokens, and uses the public ledger to record all token exchange information. When two or more users want to exchange tokens with each other, each user picks an agent for the exchange. Asset tokens are first poured into a pool and users leverage agents to obliviously retrieve tokens from the pool in order to finish the exchange. The oblivious retrieving process cut off the connection between the original user and the agent. Therefore, one cannot determine the relationship between the original users who want to exchange tokens by observing information recorded on the public ledger. To implement the design, ZeroTrade leverages different cryptography tools including zero-knowledge proof and various encryption techniques. Considering various demands in token trade, ZeroTrade also supports operations like partial token trade and revocation. A preliminary evaluation of the performance shows that ZeroTrade only adds limited burden on top of the public ledger. More detailed information can be found in the full version of the paper. Conclusion. ZeroTrade provides a privacy friendly platform for asset trading based on public ledger. For the next step, we plan to implement a fully functional prototype and considering more complex token trading scenarios. {\textcopyright} International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.},

Feature models are widely used for variability and commonality management in software product lines. Feature models are information models where a set of products are represented as a set of features in a single model. The automated analysis of feature models deals with the computer-aided extraction of information from feature models. The literature on this topic has contributed with a set of operations, techniques, tools and empirical results which have not been surveyed until now. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of feature models 20 years after of their invention. This paper contributes by bringing together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. We also present a conceptual framework to understand the different proposals as well as categorise future contributions.

Consequently, Bitcoin has the un- intuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then us- ing re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this anal- ysis, we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the chal- lenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.},

abstract = {Current interests in the context of system development include non-functional aspects of an application and the quality of the service (QoS) it provides. In video on demand applications, for instance, properties such as delay, bandwidth and CPU utilization are monitored in order to identify if they are within acceptable limits. In our approach, non-functional requirements are described by contracts. A contract specifies acceptable variations on the availability of these properties and how service replacement can be negotiated to keep the QoS of the application within the acceptable limits. In this paper we give an operational semantics for QoS contracts and report its implementation in a prototype tool that allows us to execute and analyze QoS contracts. The QoS Tool, our prototype, transforms QoS contract descriptions into modular structural operational semantics (MSOS) specifications. MSOS specifications are executable and analyzable in the Maude MSOS Tool, which uses efficient rewriting to execute, search and model checking MSOS specifications. We exemplify how the QoS Tool can be used by analyzing a video on demand application against real data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It aims to improve upon existing crypto-currency languages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum's EVM, while avoiding some of the problems they face. Simplicity comes with formal denotational semantics defined in Coq, a popular, general purpose software proof assistant. Simplicity also includes operational semantics that are defined with an abstract machine that we call the Bit Machine. The Bit Machine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution. While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary function, which we believe is enough to build useful "smart contracts" for blockchain applications.},

Indeed, many studies have highlighted ways to compromise one or several Bitcoin nodes. In this paper, we take a different perspective and study the effect of large-scale network-level attacks such as the ones that may be launched by Autonomous Systems (ASes). We show that attacks that are commonly believed to be hard, such as isolating 50{\%} of the mining power, are actually within the reach of anyone with access to a BGP-enabled network and hijacking less than 900 prefixes. Once on path, AS-level adversaries can then partition the Bitcoin network or delay block propagation significantly. The key factors that enable these attacks are the extreme centralization of Bitcoin, both from a routing and a mining perspective, along with the fact that Bitcoin messages are sent unencrypted, without integrity guarantees. We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale attacks in practice against the deployed Bitcoin software and quantify their disruptive network-wide impact. The potential damage to Bitcoin is severe. By isolating a part of the network or delaying the propagation of blocks, network-level attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of attacks such as double spending. We provide several suggestions on approaches to mitigate such attacks employing both short-term and long-term measures.},

abstract = {In open multiagent systems, agents need to model their environments in order to identify trustworthy agents. Models of the environment should be accurate so that decisions about whom to interact with can be done soundly. Traditional trust models are based on modeling specific properties of agents, such as their expertise or reliability. Building those models requires too many prior interactions to be accurate. This paper proposes an approach that is based on keeping track of outcomes of agent's actions towards others rather than modeling other agents' performances explicitly. Contrary to existing modeling approaches that require domain knowledge to build models, our proposed approach can be effectively realized in multiagent systems when the agent's actions are clearly identified. Comparisons with other modeling approaches in various environments reveal that our proposed approach can create more precise models in short time and can adjust its behavior quickly when other agents' behaviors change.},

abstract = {Digital identity is one of the oldest and hardest problems on the Internet. There is still no way to use digital credentials to prove our online identity the same way we do in the offline world. This is finally changing. First, the World Wide Web Consortium is standardizing the format of digitally-signed credentials. Secondly, public blockchains can provide decentralized registration and discovery of the public keys needed to verify digital signatures. These two steps pave the way to establish a global public utility for self-sovereign identity—lifetime portable digital identity that does not depend on any central authority and can never be taken away. The Sovrin Network has been designed exclusively for this purpose, including governance (the Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin Trust Framework), scalability (validator and observer nodes and state proofs), and accessibility (minimal cost and maximum availability). Most importantly, Sovrin implements Privacy by Design on a global scale, including pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, peer-to-peer private agents, and selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proof cryptography. The emergence of this infrastructure can transform at least four major markets: identity and access management, cybersecurity, RegTech, and data integration. To provide economic incentives for credential issuers, owners, and verifiers, the Sovrin protocol will incorporate a digital token designed expressly for privacy-preserving value exchange. The Sovrin token should enable a global marketplace for digital credentials of all types and value levels together with ancillary markets for digital credential insurance and permissioned first party data (direct from the customer).

abstract = {Blockchain-driven technologies are considered disruptive because of the availability of dis-intermediated, censorship-resistant and tamper-proof digital platforms of distributed trust. Among these technologies, smart contract platforms have the potential to take over functions usually done by intermediaries like banks, escrow or legal services. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol aiming to execute smart contracts as part of a blockchain transaction validation. We enable extensions in the execution of smart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy, correctness and verifiability. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented, since no communication between participants is requested, and contract validations do not imply the re-execution of the code by all the nodes in the network. However, proofs of correct execution are stored on the blockchain and can be verified by multiple parties. Our solution is based on programming tools which optimize the time execution and the required memory while preserving the embedded functionality.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, em-body at their core a blockchain protocol — a mechanism for a dis-tributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement proto-col exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3–7 transac-tions per second at present, irrespective of the available computa-tion capacity at hand. In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement proto-col for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzan-tine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the min-ing network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which pro-cesses a disjoint set of transactions (or " shards "). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candi-date for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine ad-versaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to 1, 600 nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.},

In autonomous open source decentralized systems this luxury is not available. We cre-ate a reputation network for decentralized marketplaces where the trust each user gives to the other users is quantifiable and expressed in mone-tary terms. We introduce a new model for bitcoin wallets in which user coins are split among trusted associates. Direct trust is defined using shared bitcoin accounts via bitcoin's 1-of-2 multisig. Indirect trust is subsequently defined transitively. This enables formal game theoretic ar-guments pertaining to risk analysis. We prove that risk and maximum flows are equivalent in our model and that our system is Sybil-resilient. Our system allows for concrete financial decisions on the subjective mon-etary amount a pseudonymous party can be trusted with. Risk remains invariant under a direct trust redistribution operation followed by a pur-chase.},

abstract = {Bitcoin utilizes Nakamoto Consensus to achieve agreement on a consistent set of transactions, in the permissionless setting, where anyone can participate in the protocol anonymously. Since its rise, many other permissionless consensus protocols have been proposed. We present SPECTRE, a new protocol for the consensus core of cryptocurrencies that remains secure even under high throughput and fast confirmation times. At any throughput, SPECTRE is resilient to attackers with up to 50{\%} of the computational power (reaching the limit defined by network congestion and bandwidth constraints). SPECTRE can operate at arbitrarily high block creation rates, which implies that its transactions confirm in mere seconds (limited mostly by the round-trip-time in the network). SPECTRE's underlying model falls into the category of partial synchronous networks: its security depends on the existence of some bound on the delivery time of messages between honest participants, but the protocol itself does not contain any parameter that depends on this bound. Hence, while other protocols that do encode such parameters must operate with extreme safety margins, SPECTRE converges according to the actual network delay. Key to SPECTRE's achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes. In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system. Our framework formalizes this weaker set of requirements for a cryptocurrency's distributed ledger. We then provide a formal proof that SPECTRE satisfies these requirements.},

Available tools are often lacking in helping programmers develop more reliable and secure applications. Formal verification is a technique able to detect software errors statically; before a product is actually shipped. Although this aspect makes this technology very appealing in principle; in practice there have been many difficulties that have hindered the application of software verifi- cation in industrial environments. In particular; in an organisation like Facebook where the release cycle is fast compared to more traditional industries; the deployment of formal techniques is highly challenging.

abstract = {Literature on business models deals extensively with how to design new business models, but hardly with how to make the transition from an existing to a newly designed business model. The transition to a new business model raises several practical and strategic issues, such as how to replace an existing value proposition with a new one, when to acquire new resources and capabilities, and when to start new partnerships. In this paper, we coin the term business model roadmapping as an approach to define the transition path from a current to a desired business model. We develop our approach based on core concepts from business model literature as well as technology roadmapping. The approach is illustrated using a simplified case study. We find that visualizing business model road maps elicits how operational actions and business model impacts are interrelated. The merits of business model roadmapping not only lie in defining a road map of actions and business model changes, but also in identifying and discussing trade-offs between strategic business model issues and operational activities. Especially if an organization still has to choose between different alternative business models, business model roadmapping may help to identify overlapping paths, path dependencies and points of no return.

Firstly, we present the core concepts at the heart of the blockchain, and we discuss the potential risks and drawbacks of public distributed ledgers, and the shift toward hybrid solutions. Secondly, we expose the main features of decentralized public ledger platforms. Thirdly, we show why the blockchain is a disruptive and foundational technology, and fourthly, we sketch out a list of important applications, bearing in mind the most recent evolutions.},

abstract = {A decision procedure implemented over a computational trust mechanism aims to allow for decisions to be made regarding whether some entity or information should be trusted. As recognised in the literature, trust is contextual, and we describe how such a context often translates into a confidence level which should be used to modify an underlying trust value. J{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}sang's Subjective Logic has long been used in the trust domain, and we show that its operators are insufficient to address this problem. We therefore provide a decision-making approach about trust which also considers the notion of confidence (based on context) through the introduction of a new operator. In particular, we introduce general requirements that must be respected when combining trustworthiness and confidence degree, and demonstrate the soundness of our new operator with respect to these properties.},

They will also need efficient price signals that motivate sustainable energy consumption behaviors and a tight real-time alignment of energy demand with supply from renewable and traditional sources. The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a rich, competitive, open-source simulation platform for future retail power markets built on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. Power TAC invites researchers to develop autonomous electricity broker agents and to pit them against best-in-class strategies in global competitions, the first of which will be held at AAAI 2013. Power TAC competitions provide compelling, actionable information for policy makers and industry leaders. We describe the competition scenario, demonstrate the realism of the Power TAC platform, and analyze key characteristics of successful brokers in one of our 2012 pilot competitions between seven research groups from five different countries.

The reality is that zkSNARKs can be reduced to four simple techniques and this blog post aims to explain them. Anyone who can understand how the RSA cryptosystem works, should also get a pretty good understanding of currently employed zkSNARKs. Let's see if it will achieve its goal!

One of the fundamental concepts of Bitcoin is that work, called mining, must be done in checking all monetary transactions, which in turn creates Bitcoins as a reward. In this paper we look at the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining. We consider if and when Bitcoin mining has been profitable compared to the energy cost of performing the mining, and conclude that specialist hardware is usually required to make Bitcoin mining profitable. We also show that the power currently used for Bitcoin mining is comparable to Ireland's electricity consumption.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology is disrupting society by enabling new kinds of disintermediated digital platforms. Furthermore, it is also providing efficiency gains on top of old existing structures by removing the need for actively intermediated data-synchronization and concurrency control. Due to this dual effect, blockchain technology has the potential to impact all sectors and layers of society, in a multitude of combined ways. While there is a lot of hype around the concept of blockchains, the phenomenon itself has remained ambiguous and misconceptions have emerged about the capabilities and the potential of blockchain technology. Drawing from ETLA's participation in blockchain research in 2014–2016, this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding on blockchain technology, its true possibilities, and its potential larger societal implications. It offers a holistic view of the key concepts and the basic principles, and the tools and the framework to understand the ongoing discussion, to critically evaluate different viewpoints, and to delve deeper in a constructed manner},

In the second section, I define trust and the general conditions under which it becomes relevant for cooperation. In the third, I discuss the extent to which cooperation can come about independently of trust, and also whether trust can be seen as a result rather than a precondition of cooperation. In the final section, I address the question of whether there are rational reasons for people to trust - and especially whether there are reasons to trust trust and, correspondingly, distrust distrust.},

abstract = {Abstract Trust and reputation are central to effective interactions in open multi-agent systems (MAS) in which agents, that are owned by a variety of stakeholders, continuously enter and leave the system. This openness means existing trust and reputation models cannot readily be used since their performance suffers when there are various (unforseen) changes in the environment. To this end, this paper presents FIRE, a trust and reputation model that integrates a number of information sources to produce a comprehensive assessment of an agents likely performance in open systems. Specifically, FIRE incorporates interaction trust, role-based trust, witness reputation, and certified reputation to provide trust metrics in most circumstances. FIRE is empirically evaluated and is shown to help agents gain better utility (by effectively selecting appropriate interaction partners) than our benchmarks in a variety of agent populations. It is also shown that FIRE is able to effectively respond to changes that occur in an agents environment.},

abstract = {Social media have caused information overload for users who normally have limited information processing capability, thus making the issue of task-information fit become critical. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) provides a theoretical underpinning for understanding the informational influence processes underlying the effectiveness of dual-route persuasion and attitude change. Drawing on the ELM, the current study explores the effectiveness of dual-route persuasion on informational fit-to-task so as to highlight the importance of task-information fit. Specifically, the current study explores the effects of the central route (information quality of social media) and the peripheral route (source credibility of social media and reputation of social media) on informational fit-to-task with focused immersion as an ability variable. The results indicate that focused immersion positively moderates the effect of information quality on informational fit-to-task and negatively moderates the effect of reputation on informational fit-to-task. The findings and their implications are discussed.},

We gather and analyze data over eight months between the end of 2011 and 2012, including daily crawls of the marketplace for nearly six months in 2012. We obtain a detailed picture of the type of goods sold on Silk Road, and of the revenues made both by sellers and Silk Road operators. Through examining over 24,400 separate items sold on the site, we show that Silk Road is overwhelmingly used as a market for controlled substances and narcotics, and that most items sold are available for less than three weeks. The major-ity of sellers disappears within roughly three months of their arrival, but a core of 112 sellers has been present throughout our measure-ment interval. We evaluate the total revenue made by all sellers, from public listings, to slightly over USD 1.2 million per month; this corresponds to about USD 92,000 per month in commissions for the Silk Road operators. We further show that the marketplace has been operating steadily, with daily sales and number of sellers overall increasing over our measurement interval. We discuss eco-nomic and policy implications of our analysis and results, including ethical considerations for future research in this area.},

This mechanism would be more suitable for large number of au-tonomous service providers on internet compared with the current service-oriented computing framework. Collabora-tion is an important issue in this mechanism. This paper focuses on the collaboration issue in RDAC. First, we define the assignment problem in RDAC and show that it is NP-complete. Then, we model it as a Kripke struc-ture with normative systems on it. This makes it possible to bridge the assignment problem and the existing efforts in normative systems, games, mechanisms, etc. Thirdly, a negotiation-based approach is given to solve the problem and the performance of the negotiation is evaluated by sim-ulation. Finally, a tool for RDAC has been implemented to put it into practice and for further testing and evaluation.},

Legal and ethical requirements may prevent the use of cloud-based machine learning solutions for such tasks. In this work, we will present a method to convert learned neural networks to CryptoNets, neural networks that can be applied to encrypted data. This allows a data owner to send their data in an encrypted form to a cloud service that hosts the network. The encryption ensures that the data remains confidential since the cloud does not have access to the keys needed to decrypt it. Nevertheless, we will show that the cloud service is capable of applying the neural network to the encrypted data to make encrypted predictions, and also return them in encrypted form. These encrypted predictions can be sent back to the owner of the secret key who can decrypt them. Therefore, the cloud service does not gain any information about the raw data nor about the prediction it made. We demonstrate CryptoNets on the MNIST optical character recognition tasks. CryptoNets achieve 99{\%} accuracy and can make more than 51000 predictions per hour on a single PC. Therefore, they allow high throughput, accurate, and private predictions.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of Bitcoin[Nak09] in 2009, and the multiple computer science and electronic cash innovations it brought, there has been great interest in the potential of decentralised cryptocurrencies. At the same time, implementation changes to the consensus- critical parts of Bitcoin must necessarily be handled very conservatively. As a result, Bitcoin has greater difficulty than other Internet protocols in adapting to new demands and accommodating new innovation. We propose a new technology, pegged sidechains, which enables bitcoins and other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains. This gives users access to new and innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets they already own. By reusing Bitcoin's currency, these systems can more easily interoperate with each other and with Bitcoin, avoiding the liquidity shortages and market fluctuations associated with new currencies. Since sidechains are separate systems, technical and economic innovation is not hindered. Despite bidirectional transferability between Bitcoin and pegged sidechains, they are isolated: in the case of a cryptographic break (or malicious design) in a sidechain, the damage is entirely confined to the sidechain itself. This paper lays out pegged sidechains, their implementation requirements, and the work needed to fully benefit from the future of interconnected blockchains.},

The scientific research in this field has considerably increased, and in fact, reputation and trust mechanisms have been already considered a key elements in the design of multi-agent systems. In this paper we provide a survey that, far from being exhaustive, intends to show the most representative models that currently exist in the literature. For this enterprise we consider several dimensions of analysis that appeared in three existing surveys, and provide new dimensions that can be complementary to the existing ones and that have not been treated directly. Moreover, besides showing the original classification that each one of the surveys provide, we also classify models that where not taken into account by the original surveys. The paper illustrates the proliferation in the past few years of models that follow a more cognitive approach, in which trust and reputation representation as mental attitudes is as important as the final values of trust and reputation. Furthermore, we provide an objective definition of trust, based on Castelfranchi's idea that trust implies a decision to rely on someone.},

abstract = {Overview. A blockchain is best understood in the model of state-machine replication [8], where a service maintains some state and clients invoke operations that transform the state and generate outputs. A blockchain emulates a " trusted " computing service through a distributed protocol, run by nodes con-nected over the Internet. The service represents or creates an asset, in which all nodes have some stake. The nodes share the common goal of running the service but do not necessarily trust each other for more. In a " permissionless " blockchain such as the one underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, anyone can operate a node and participate through spending CPU cycles and demonstrating a " proof-of-work. " On the other hand, blockchains in the " permissioned " model control who participates in validation and in the protocol; these nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium. A report of Swanson compares the two models [9]. Hyperledger. The Hyperledger Project (www.hyperledger.org) is a collaborative effort to cre-ate an enterprise-grade, open-source distributed ledger framework and code base. It aims to advance blockchain technology by identifying and realizing a cross-industry open standard platform for dis-tributed ledgers, which can transform the way business transactions are conducted globally. Established as a project of the Linux Foundation in early 2016, the Hyperledger Project currently has more than 50 members. Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric (github.com/hyperledger/fabric) is an imple-mentation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts, leveraging familiar and proven technologies, with a modular architecture allowing pluggable implementations of various functions. It is one of multiple projects currently in incubation under the Hyperledger Project. A developer-preview of the Hyperledger Fabric (called " v0.5-developer-preview ") has been released in June 2016 (github.com/hyperledger/fabric/wiki/Fabric-Releases). The distributed ledger protocol of the fabric is run by peers. The fabric distinguishes between two kinds of peers: A validating peer is a node on the network responsible for running consensus,},

abstract = {Consider a weak client that wishes to delegate a computation to an untrusted server, and then verify the correctness of the result. When the client uses only a single untrusted server, current techniques suffer from disadvantages such as computational inefficiency for the client or the server, limited functionality, or high round complexity. We demonstrate relatively efficient and general solutions where the client delegates the computation to several servers, and is guaranteed to determine the correct answer as long as even a single server is honest. We call such protocols Refereed Delegation of Computation (RDoC) and show: 1. A computationally secure protocol for any efficiently computable function, with logarithmically many rounds, based on any collision-resistant hash family. In our description of this protocol, we model the computation as running on a Turing Machine, but the protocol can be adapted to other computation models. We present an adaptation for the X86 computation model and a prototype implementation, called Quin, for Windows executables. We describe the architecture of Quin and experiment with several parameters on live cloud servers. We show that the protocol is practical, can work with real-world cloud servers, and is efficient for both the servers and for the client.2. A 1-round statistically secure protocol for any log-space uniform NC circuit. In contrast, in the single server setting all known one-round delegation protocols are computationally sound. The protocol extends the arithemetization techniques of Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum (STOC 08) and Feige and Kilian (STOC 97).},

abstract = {We investigate a family of bugs in blockchain-based smart contracts, which we call event-ordering (or EO) bugs. These bugs are intimately related to the dynamic ordering of contract events, i.e., calls of its functions on the blockchain, and enable potential exploits of millions of USD worth of Ether. Known examples of such bugs and prior techniques to detect them have been restricted to a small number of event orderings, typicall 1 or 2. Our work provides a new formulation of this general class of EO bugs as finding concurrency properties arising in long permutations of such events. The technical challenge in detecting our formulation of EO bugs is the inherent combinatorial blowup in path and state space analysis, even for simple contracts. We propose the first use of partial-order reduction techniques, using happen-before relations extracted automatically for contracts, along with several other optimizations built on a dynamic symbolic execution technique. We build an automatic tool called ETHRACER that requires no hints from users and runs directly on Ethereum bytecode. It flags 7-11{\%} of over ten thousand contracts analyzed in roughly 18.5 minutes per contract, providing compact event traces that human analysts can run as witnesses. These witnesses are so compact that confirmations require only a few minutes of human effort. Half of the flagged contracts have subtle EO bugs, including in ERC-20 contracts that carry hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether. Thus, ETHRACER is effective at detecting a subtle yet dangerous class of bugs which existing tools miss.},

In this paper we present a principled desiderata for discounting and fusion operators in SL. Building upon this we present operators that satisfy these desirable properties, including a family of discount operators. We then show, through a rigorous empirical study, that specific, geometrically interpreted operators significantly outperform standard SL operators in estimating ground truth. These novel operators offer real advantages for computational models of trust and reputation, in which they may be employed without modifying other aspects of an existing system.},

abstract = {Half a decade after Bitcoin became the first widely used cryptocurrency, blockchains are receiving considerable interest from industry and the research community. Modern blockchains feature services such as name registration and smart contracts. Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively poorly investigated, despite the fact that they move considerable assets. In this paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains---Ethereum, Namecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract functionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on the network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small size of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process.},

abstract = {What do the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and hydraulic excavators have in common? They are all examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. These products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out sound business practices in established markets. In The Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton M. Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies. At the heart of The Innovator's Dilemma is how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing. Succinct and clearly written, The Innovator's Dilemma is an important book that belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended. -Harry C. Edwards In this revolutionary bestseller, Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership, or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.Focusing on "disruptive technology" of the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and the hydraulic excavator, Christensen shows why most companies miss "the next great wave." Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Revised, updated, and with a new chapter, this book continues to take the radical position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right. It demonstrates why outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology-and it explains how to avoid a similar fate. Drawing on insights from a number of industries-such as the computer and disk drive industries, discount retailing, minimills, pharmaceuticals, and the automobile industry-Christensen shows why good management often turns out to be all wrong-and what to do about it.},

abstract = {Recently there has been much academic and industrial interest in practical implementations of zero-knowledge proofs. These techniques allow a party to prove to another party that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information. In a Bitcoin-like system, this allows a payer to prove validity of a payment without disclosing the payment's details. Unfortunately, the existing systems for generating such proofs are very expensive, especially in terms of memory overhead. Worse yet, these systems are “monolithic”, meaning they are limited by the memory resources of a single machine. This severely limits their practical applicability. We describe DIZK, a system that distributes the generation of a zero-knowledge proof across machines in a compute cluster. Using a set of new techniques, we show that DIZK scales to computations of up to billions of logical gates (100 times larger than prior art) at a cost of 10 $\mu$s per gate (100 times faster than prior art). We then use DIZK to study various security applications.},

Each DID Document contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints. Cryptographic material combined with authentication suites provide a set of mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g. public keys, pseudonymous biometric templates, etc.). Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the DID subject. This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that all DIDs support.},

abstract = {Present-day blockchain architectures all suffer from a number of issues not least practical means of extensi-bility and scalability. We believe this stems from tying two very important parts of the consensus architecture, namely canonicality and validity, too closely together. This paper introduces an architecture, the heterogeneous multi-chain, which fundamentally sets the two apart. In compartmentalising these two parts, and by keeping the overall functionality provided to an absolute minimum of security and transport, we introduce practical means of core extensibility in situ. Scalability is addressed through a divide-and-conquer approach to these two functions, scaling out of its bonded core through the incentivisation of untrusted public nodes. The heterogeneous nature of this architecture enables many highly divergent types of consensus systems interop-erating in a trustless, fully decentralised " federation " , allowing open and closed networks to have trust-free access to each other. We put forward a means of providing backwards compatibility with one or more pre-existing networks such as Ethereum. We believe that such a system provides a useful base-level component in the overall search for a practically implementable system capable of achieving global-commerce levels of scalability and privacy.},

In sequential languages, dynamic contracts are usually expressed as boolean functions without externally observable effects, written within the language. We propose an analogous notion of concurrent contracts for languages with session-typed message-passing concurrency. Concurrent contracts are partial identity processes that monitor the bidirectional communication along channels and raise an alarm if a contract is violated. Concurrent contracts are session-typed in the usual way and must also satisfy a transparency requirement, which guarantees that terminating compliant programs with and without the contracts are observationally equivalent. We illustrate concurrent contracts with several examples. We also show how to generate contracts from a refinement session-type system and show that the resulting monitors are redundant for programs that are well-typed.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

In our setting, substitutable preferences are sufficient to guarantee the existence of stable outcomes; moreover, in contrast to results for the setting of many-to-one matching with contracts, if any agent's preferences are not substitutable, then the existence of a stable outcome can not be guaranteed. In many-to-many matching with contracts, a new market design issue arises: The design of the contract language can impact the set of stable outcomes. Bundling contractual primitives encourages substitutability of agents' preferences over contracts and makes stable outcomes more likely to exist; however, bundling also makes the contractual language less expressive. Consequently, in choosing contract language, market designers face a tradeoff between expressiveness and stability.},

abstract = {Fairness in Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) is known to be impossible to achieve in the presence of a dishonest majority. Previous works have proposed combining MPC protocols with Cryptocur-rencies in order to financially punish aborting adversaries, providing an incentive for parties to honestly follow the protocol. This approach also yields privacy-preserving Smart Contracts, where private inputs can be processed with MPC in order to determine the distribution of funds given to the contract. Unfortunately, the focus of existing work is on proving that this approach is possible and they present monolithic and mostly inefficient constructions. In this work, we put forth the first modular construction of "Insured MPC", where the result of the private computation of parties either yields an output describing how to distribute funds or a proof that a set of parties has misbehaved, allowing for financial punishments. Moreover, both the output and the proof of cheating are publicly verifiable, allowing third parties to independently validate an execution. We present a highly efficient protocol which allows public verification of cheating behavior during the output stage. This scheme is constructed using a publicly verifiable homomorphic commitment scheme, for which we propose an efficient construction. Furthermore, we construct a compiler that uses any such scheme together with a Smart Contract to implement Insured MPC. This compiler requires a standard (non-private) Smart Contract. Our results are proven in the Universal Composability framework using a Global Random Oracle as the setup assumption. From a theoretical perspective, our general results provide the first characterization of sufficient properties that MPC protocols must achieve in order to be efficiently combined with Cryptocurrencies, as well as insights on publicly verifiable protocols. On the other hand, all our constructions and protocols are highly efficient and allow for a fast implementation.},

abstract = {—Vulnerability reward programs, a.k.a. bug bounties, are a popular tool that could help prevent software exploits. Today, however, they lack rigorous principles for setting bounty amounts and require high payments to attract economically rational hackers. Rather than claim bounties for serious bugs, hackers often sell or exploit them. We present the Hydra Framework, the first general, principled approach to modeling and administering bug bounties and boosting incentives for hackers to report bugs. The key idea is what we call an exploit gap, a program transformation that enables runtime detection of security-critical bugs. The Hydra Framework transforms programs via N-of-N-version program-ming (NNVP), a variant of classical N-version programming that executes multiple independent program instances. We apply the Hydra Framework to smart contracts, small programs that execute on blockchains. We show how Hydra contracts greatly amplify the power of bounties to incentivize bug disclosure by economically rational adversaries, establishing the first framework for economic evaluation of smart contract security. We also model powerful adversaries capable of bug withholding, exploiting race conditions in blockchains to claim bounties before honest users can. We present Submarine Commit-ments, a countermeasure of independent interest that conceals transactions on blockchains. We present a simple core Hydra Framework for Ethereum. We report the implementation of two Hydra contracts—an ERC20 token contract and a Monty-Hall-like game.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof-of-work “mining” process having no central party or trusted setup. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows one to include a Pedersen Commitment in a ring signature. This construction results in a digital currency with hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the {\#}bitcoin-wizards IRC channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Evidence has been recently provided that beacon, an ubiquitin-like protein overexpressed in the hypothalamus of Israeli sand rat, is also expressed in several endocrine glands of the Wistar rat, including adrenal cortex. Moreover, it has been shown that the in vivo administration of beacon[47-73] (hereinafter, beacon) evokes within 60 min a marked decrease in the plasma concentrations of ACTH and corticosterone. Hence, we have investigated the effect of beacon (4x10(-9) or 4x10(-7) M) on the secretion and growth of cultured rat and human zona fasciculata/reticularis (ZF/R) cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detected beacon mRNA in all human adrenal cortexes examined. A 3-h exposure to beacon was ineffective, but prolonged (24 and 96 h) exposures significantly lowered basal corticosterone and cortisol secretion from cultured rat and human ZF/R cells, respectively. Moreover, beacon (4x10(-7) M) counteracted the secretagogue action of 10(-8) M ACTH on cultured cells. The 96-h exposure to beacon concentration-dependently decreased basal proliferation rate of cultured cells, without inducing significant changes in the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Beacon (4x10(-7) M) significantly inhibited the proliferogenic effect of 10(-8) M adrenomedullin. In light of the involvement of ubiquitin-like proteins in the control of cell cycle and protein sorting and degradation, the hypothesis is advanced that the inhibitory effect of beacon on the secretion and growth of cultured rat ZF/R cells may be connected to its stimulating effect on proteolysis of steroidogenic enzymes and proteins involved in cell replication.},

abstract = {Automated negotiation plays an important role in dynamic trading in e-commerce. Its research largely focuses on negotiation protocol and strategy design. There is a paucity of further scientific investigation and a pressing need on the implementation of multi-strategy selection, which is crucially useful in human-computer negotiation to achieve better online negotiation outcomes. The lack of such studies has decelerated the process of applying automated negotiation to real world problems. To address the critical issue, this paper develops a multi-strategy negotiating agent system. More specifically, we formally define the agent's conceptual model, and design its abstract software architecture. Grounded on the integration of the time-dependent and behavior-dependent tactics, we also develop a multi-strategy selection theoretical model and algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this model algorithm, we implement a prototype and conduct numerous experiments. The experimental analysis not only confirms our model's effectiveness but also reveals some insights into future work about human-computer negotiation systems, which will be widely used in the future B2C e-commerce.},

They can secure, in plain sight, all kinds of transactions ---such as titles, sales, and payments--- in the exact order in which they occur. Public ledgers not only curb corruption, but also enable very sophisticated applications ---such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. As currently implemented, however, they scale poorly and cannot achieve their potential. Algorand is a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not "fork" with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) message-passing Byzantine agreement. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a money platform.},

abstract = {Techniques originating from the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) areas have extensively been applied to develop intelligent and pervasive systems such as assistive monitoring, feedback in telerehabilitation, energy management, and negotiation. Those application domains particularly include three major characteristics: intelligence, autonomy and real-time behavior. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are one of the major technological paradigms that are used to implement such systems. However, they mainly address the first two characteristics, but miss to comply with strict timing constraints. The timing compliance is crucial for safety-critical applications operating in domains such as healthcare and automotive. The main reasons for this lack of real-time satisfiability in MAS originate from current theories, standards, and technological implementations. In particular, internal agent schedulers, communication middlewares, and negotiation protocols have been identified as co-factors inhibiting the real-time compliance. This paper provides an analysis of such MAS components and pave the road for achieving the MAS compliance with strict timing constraints, thus fostering reliability and predictability.},

It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can find agreements on their shared states without trusting a central integration point or any particular participating components. Considering the block-chain as a software connector helps make explicitly important architectural considerations on the resulting performance and quality attributes (for example, security, privacy, scalability and sustainability) of the system. Based on our experience in several projects using blockchain, in this paper we provide rationales to support the architectural decision on whether to employ a decentralized blockchain as opposed to other software solutions, like traditional shared data storage. Additionally, we explore spe-cific implications of using the blockchain as a software connector including design trade-offs regarding quality attributes.},

abstract = {This paper describes and motivates a new decision theory known as functional decision theory (FDT), as distinct from causal decision theory and evidential decision theory. Functional decision theorists hold that the normative principle for action is to treat one's decision as the output of a fixed mathematical function that answers the question, "Which output of this very function would yield the best outcome?" Adhering to this principle delivers a number of benefits, including the ability to maximize wealth in an array of traditional decision-theoretic and game-theoretic problems where CDT and EDT perform poorly. Using one simple and coherent decision rule, functional decision theorists (for example) achieve more utility than CDT on Newcomb's problem, more utility than EDT on the smoking lesion problem, and more utility than both in Parfit's hitchhiker problem. In this paper, we define FDT, explore its prescriptions in a number of different decision problems, compare it to CDT and EDT, and give philosophical justifications for FDT as a normative theory of decision-making.},

A party is modeled as a negotiating agent composed of a communication module, a control module, a reasoning module, and a knowledge base. The control module is expressed as a statechart, and the reasoning module as a defeasible logic program. A strategy specification therefore consists of a statechart, a set of defeasible rules, and a set of initial facts. Such a specification can be dynamically plugged into an agent shell incorporating a statechart interpreter and a defeasible logic inference engine, in order to yield an agent capable of participating in a given type of negotiations. The choice of statecharts and defeasible logic with respect to other formalisms is justified against a set of desirable criteria, and their suitability is illustrated through concrete examples of bidding and multi-lateral bargaining scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We show that our exceptions provide enough guarantees to simplify high-level programming language semantics and debugging, but are significantly cheaper to enforce than traditional data-race detection. To make the performance cost of enforcement negligible, we propose architecture support for accurately detecting and precisely delivering these exceptions. We evaluate the suitability of our model as well as the behavior of our architectural mechanisms using the PARSEC benchmark suite and commercial applications. Our results show that the exception model largely reflects how programmers are already writing code and that the main memory, traffic and performance overheads of the enforcement mechanisms we propose are very low.},

Contingency contracts address this, but are often impractical. As an alternative, we propose leveled commitment contracts. The level of commitment is set by breach penalties. To be freed from the contract, an agent simply pays the penalty to the other party. A self-interested agent will be reluctant to breach because the other party might breach, in which case the former agent is freed from the contract, does not incur a penalty, and collects a penalty from the breacher. We show that, despite such strategic breach, leveled commitment increases the expected payoff to both contract parties and can enable deals that are impossible under full commitment. Asymmetric beliefs are also discussed. Different decommitting mechanisms are introduced and compared. Practical prescriptions for market designers are provided.

abstract = {In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts do not allow agents to efficiently accomodate future events. Game theory has proposed contigency contracts to solve this problem. Among computational agents, contigency contracts are often impractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipated future events to be conditioned on, and because some events are not mutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitment contracting protocol that allows self-interested agents to efficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility of unilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. A decommitment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to be freed from the contract, an agent only pays this penalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis of several contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature in a contracting protocol increases Pareto efficiency of deals and can make contracts individually rational when no full commitment contract can. This advantage holds even if the agents decommit manipulatively.},

@techreport{Hildenbrandt2017,
abstract = {A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied cryptography community is that of smart contracts: self-executing financial instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum, which has grown to secure approximately 30 billion USD of currency value and in excess of 300,000 daily transactions. Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been marred by a repeated series of security vulnerabilities and high profile contract failures. To address these failures, the Ethereum community has turned to formal verification and program analysis which show great promise due to the computational simplicity and bounded-time execution inherent to smart contracts. Despite this, no fully formal, rigorous, comprehensive, and executable semantics of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) currently exists, leaving a lack of rigor on which to base such tools. In this work, we present KEVM, the first fully executable formal semantics of the EVM, the bytecode language in which smart contracts are executed. We create this semantics in a framework for executable semantics, the K framework. We show that our semantics not only passes the official 40,683-test stress test suite for EVM implementations, but also reveals ambiguities and potential sources of error in the existing on-paper formalization of EVM semantics [45] on which our work is based. These properties make KEVM an ideal formal reference implementation against which other implementations can be evaluated. We proceed to argue for a semantics-first formal verification approach for EVM contracts, and demonstrate its practicality by using KEVM to verify practically important properties over the arithmetic operation of an example smart contract and the correct operation of a token transfer function in a second contract. We show that our approach is feasible and not computationally restrictive. We hope that our work serves as the base for the development of a wide range of useful formally derived tools for Ethereum, including model checkers, certified compilers, and program equivalence checkers.},

abstract = {This paper reports the outcome of a series of interviews and focus group meetings with professionals working in post-trade processing and the provision of mutual distributed ledger services. The objective was to elicit and document views on three research hypotheses about the potential impact of mutual distributed ledger technology (‘block chain') in global securities markets. These hypotheses are on the appropriate access to mutual distributed ledger; on whether change would be piecemeal or ‘big bang'; and on the extent to which applying mutual distributed ledger in securities settlement would require major changes in business processes. Our research finds that while the use of block chain to validate operational data in mutual distributed ledgers can yield substantial reductions in both cost and risk, the concept of data sharing itself is far from new. Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations of the extent to which the technology on its own will address the underlying need for co-ordination of business processes both within and between firms. Achieving significant benefits from mutual distributed ledgers will require board level buy-in to a substantial commitment of time and resource with relatively little short term payoff.},

In other robotics applications many robust systems already exist for localization such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and LIDAR based SLAM. These approaches either require special hardware or are very computationally expensive and are not suitable for the Nao robot, the current robot of choice for the SPL. Therefore novel approaches to localization in the RoboCup SPL environment are required. In this paper we present a new approach to localization in the SPL which relies primarily on the information contained within white field markings while being efficient enough to run in real time on board a Nao robot. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial com-putation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners' computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an ill-fated choice, which we call the verifier's dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de-velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com-putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap-plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two dis-tinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.},

Our theoretical analysis captures the precise tradeoff between the network delay and the mining power of the attacker needed to double spend in Ethereum with high probability. We quantify our probabilistic analysis with statistics taken from the R3 consortium, and show that a single machine needs 20 minutes to attack the consortium. Finally, we run an Ethereum private chain in a distributed system with similar settings as R3 to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and discuss the application of the Balance attack to Bitcoin. Our results clearly confirm that main proof-of-work blockchain protocols can be badly suited for consortium blockchains.},

abstract = {To date, a variety of automated negotiation agents have been cre-ated. While each of these agents has been shown to be effective in negotiating with people in specific environments, they lack natu-ral language processing support required to enable real-world types of interactions. In this paper we present NegoChat, the first nego-tiation agent that successfully addresses this limitation. NegoChat contains several significant research contributions. First, we found that simply modifying existing agents to include an NLP module is insufficient to create these agents. Instead, the agents' strate-gies must be modified to address partial agreements and issue-by-issue interactions. Second, we present NegoChat's negotiation al-gorithm. This algorithm is based on bounded rationality, and specif-ically Aspiration Adaptation Theory (AAT). As per AAT, issues are addressed based on people's typical urgency, or order of impor-tance. If an agreement cannot be reached based on the value the human partner demands, the agent retreats, or downwardly lowers the value of previously agreed upon issues so that a " good enough " agreement can be reached on all issues. This incremental approach is fundamentally different from all other negotiation agents, includ-ing the state-of-the-art KBAgent. Finally, we present a rigorous evaluation of NegoChat, showing its effectiveness.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

abstract = {Trust is a central concept in public-key cryptography infrastruc- ture and in security in general. We study its initial quanti cation and its spread patterns. There is empirical evidence that in trust-based reputation model for virtual communities, it pays to restrict the clusters of agents to small sets with high mutual trust. We propose and motivate a mathematical model, where this phenomenon emerges naturally. In our model, we sepa- rate trust values from their weights. We motivate this separation using real examples, and show that in this model, trust converges to the extremes, agreeing with and accentuating the observed phenomenon. Speci cally, in our model, cliques of agents of maximal mutual trust are formed, and the trust between any two agents that do not maximally trust each other, con- verges to zero. We o¤er initial practical relaxations to the model that preserve some of the theoretical avor.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen remarkable successes in rigorous engineering: using mathematically rigorous semantic models (not just idealised calculi) of real-world processors, programming languages, protocols, and security mechanisms, for testing, proof, analysis, and design. Building these models is challenging, requiring experimentation, dialogue with vendors or standards bodies, and validation; their scale adds engineering issues akin to those of programming to the task of writing clear and usable mathematics. But language and tool support for specification is lacking. Proof assistants can be used but bring their own difficulties, and a model produced in one, perhaps requiring many person-years effort and maintained over an extended period, cannot be used by those familiar with another. We introduce Lem, a language for engineering reusable large-scale semantic models. The Lem design takes inspiration both from functional programming languages and from proof assistants, and Lem definitions are translatable into OCaml for testing, Coq, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL for proof, and LaTeX and HTML for presentation. This requires a delicate balance of expressiveness, careful library design, and implementation of transformations - akin to compilation, but subject to the constraint of producing usable and human-readable code for each target. Lem's effectiveness is demonstrated by its use in practice.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies, based on and led by Bitcoin, have shown promise as infrastructure for pseudonymous online payments, cheap remittance, trustless digital asset exchange, and smart contracts. However, Bitcoin-derived blockchain protocols have inherent scalability limits that trade-off between throughput and latency and withhold the realization of this potential. This paper presents Bitcoin-NG, a new blockchain protocol designed to scale. Based on Bitcoin's blockchain protocol, Bitcoin-NG is Byzantine fault tolerant, is robust to extreme churn, and shares the same trust model obviating qualitative changes to the ecosystem. In addition to Bitcoin-NG, we introduce several novel metrics of interest in quantifying the security and efficiency of Bitcoin-like blockchain protocols. We implement Bitcoin-NG and perform large-scale experiments at 15{\%} the size of the operational Bitcoin system, using unchanged clients of both protocols. These experiments demonstrate that Bitcoin-NG scales optimally, with bandwidth limited only by the capacity of the individual nodes and latency limited only by the propagation time of the network.},

abstract = {Many crowdsourcing scenarios are heterogeneous in the sense that, not only the workers' types (e.g., abilities, costs) are different, but the beliefs (probabilistic knowledge) about their respective types are also different. In this paper, we design an incentive mechanism for such scenarios using an asymmetric all-pay contest (or auction) model. Our design objective is an optimal mechanism, i.e., one that maximizes the crowdsourcing revenue minus cost. To achieve this, we furnish the contest with a prize tuple which is an array of reward functions for each potential winner (worker). We prove and characterize the unique equilibrium of this contest, and solve the optimal prize tuple. In addition, this study discovers a counter-intuitive property, strategy autonomy (SA), which means that heterogeneous workers behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. In game-theoretical terms, it says that an asymmetric auction admits a symmetric equilibrium. Not only theoretically interesting, but SA also has important practical implications on mechanism complexity, energy efficiency, crowdsourcing revenue, and system scalability. By scrutinizing seven mechanisms, our extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of our mechanism as well as offers insights into the SA property.},

Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and unpredictable behavior. Members of such societies may fail to, or even choose not to, conform to the norms governing their interactions. It has been argued that systems of this type should have a formal, declarative, verifiable, and meaningful semantics. We present a theoretical and computational framework being developed for the executable specification of open agent societies. We adopt an external perspective and view societies as instances of normative systems. In this article, we demonstrate how the frame- work can be applied to specifying and executing a contract-net protocol. The specification is formalized in two action languages, the C+ language and the Event Calculus, and executed using respective software implementations, the Causal Calculator and the Society Visualizer. We evaluate our executable specification in the light of the presented case study, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the employed action languages for the specification of open agent societies.},

abstract = {We present Dynamic Epistemic Temporal Logic, a framework for reasoning about operations on multi-agent Kripke models that contain a designated temporal relation. These operations are natural extensions of the well-known "action models" from Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Our "temporal action models" may be used to define a number of informational actions that can modify the "objective" temporal structure of a model along with the agents' basic and higher-order knowledge and beliefs about this structure, including their beliefs about the time. In essence, this approach provides one way to extend the domain of action model-style operations from atemporal Kripke models to temporal Kripke models in a manner that allows actions to control the flow of time. We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models. We also study preservation of important epistemic-temporal properties of temporal Kripke models under temporal action model-induced operations, provide complete axiomatizations for two theories of temporal action models, and connect our approach with previous work on time in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.},

abstract = {The vast majority of theoretical results in machine learning and statistics assume that the available training data is a reasonably reliable reflection of the phenomena to be learned or estimated. Similarly, the majority of machine learning and statistical techniques used in practice are brittle to the presence of large amounts of biased or malicious data. In this work we consider two frameworks in which to study estimation, learning, and optimization in the presence of significant fractions of arbitrary data. The first framework, list-decodable learning, asks whether it is possible to return a list of answers, with the guarantee that at least one of them is accurate. For example, given a dataset of {\$}n{\$} points for which an unknown subset of {\$}\backslashalpha n{\$} points are drawn from a distribution of interest, and no assumptions are made about the remaining {\$}(1-\backslashalpha)n{\$} points, is it possible to return a list of {\$}\backslashoperatorname{\{}poly{\}}(1/\backslashalpha){\$} answers, one of which is correct? The second framework, which we term the semi-verified learning model, considers the extent to which a small dataset of trusted data (drawn from the distribution in question) can be leveraged to enable the accurate extraction of information from a much larger but untrusted dataset (of which only an {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-fraction is drawn from the distribution). We show strong positive results in both settings, and provide an algorithm for robust learning in a very general stochastic optimization setting. This general result has immediate implications for robust estimation in a number of settings, including for robustly estimating the mean of distributions with bounded second moments, robustly learning mixtures of such distributions, and robustly finding planted partitions in random graphs in which significant portions of the graph have been perturbed by an adversary.},

abstract = {We present Logically Qualified Data Types, abbreviated to Liquid Types, a system that combines Hindley-Milner type inference with Predicate Abstraction to automatically infer dependent types precise enough to prove a variety of safety properties. Liquid types allow programmers to reap many of the benefits of dependent types, namely static verification of critical properties and the elimination of ex- pensive run-time checks, without paying the heavy price of of manual annotation. We have implemented liquid type inference in Dsolve, which takes as input an Ocaml program and a set of logical qualifiers and infers dependent types for the expressions in the Ocaml program. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we describe experiments using Dsolve to statically verify the safety of array accesses on a set of Ocaml benchmarks that were previously annotated with dependent types as part of the DML project. We show that when used in conjunction with an elementary method for automatically generat- ing qualifiers from program text, Dsolve reduces the amount of manual annotation required for proving safety from 31{\%} of program text to under 1{\%}.},

abstract = {It is a standard feature of norm-governed institutions that designated agents are empowered to create particular kinds of states of affairs by means of the performance of specified types of actions. Frequently, the states of affairs are of a normative kind, in the sense that they pertain to rights and obligations, as for instance when a Head of Department signs a purchase agreement and thereby creates an obligation on his employer to pay for goods received. We use the term institutionalised power to stand for the notion of power we here seek to explicate. Following a lead from jurisprudential discussions of legal power, we distinguish institutionalised power from permission and practical possibility. We define a conditional connective intended to capture the consequence relation implicit in statements of the form: according to the constraints operative in institutions, the performance of some act A by agent x counts as a means of creating state of affairs B. When combined with deontic and action logics, the new connective facilitates the analysis of a number of notions crucial to the understanding of organised interaction in institutions, such as authoriso.tzon and delegation. We conclude with some illustrations of the expressive power of the new logical language.},

abstract = {We present cryptocurrency-based lottery protocols that do not require any collateral from the players. Previous protocols for this task required a security deposit that is {\$}O(N{\^{}}2){\$} times larger than the bet amount, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of players. Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket construction, and require only {\$}O(\backslashlog N){\$} rounds. Our lottery protocols thus represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with little money to participate, and because of the time value of money. The Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin implementation requires an {\$}O(2{\^{}}N){\$} off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important implications. We also describe a minimal modification to the Bitcoin protocol that would eliminate the exponential blowup.},

abstract = {In product line engineering, systems are developed in families and differences between family members are expressed in terms of features. Formal modelling and verification is an important issue in this context as more and more critical systems are developed this way. Since the number of systems in a family can be exponential in the number of features, two major challenges are the scalable modelling and the efficient verification of system behaviour. Currently, the few attempts to address them fail to recognise the importance of features as a unit of difference, or do not offer means for automated verification. In this paper, we tackle those challenges at a fundamental level. We first extend transition systems with features in order to describe the combined behaviour of an entire system family. We then define and implement a model checking technique that allows to verify such transition systems against temporal properties. An empirical evaluation shows substantial gains over classical approaches.},

As a first necessary step towards this goal, this paper presents a systematic literature review of studies involving MAS and BCT as reconciling solutions.

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to re-lying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a gen-eralization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently in-troduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results in-clude definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's " gas " fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.},

Scilla provides a clean separation between the communication aspect of smart contracts on a blockchain, allowing for the rich interaction patterns, and a programming component, which enjoys principled semantics and is amenable to formal verification. Scilla is not meant to be a high-level programming language, and we are going to use it as a translation target for high-level languages, such as Solidity, for performing program analysis and verification, before further compilation to an executable bytecode. We describe the automata-based model of Scilla, present its programming component and show how contract definitions in terms of automata streamline the process of mechanised verification of their safety and temporal properties.},

abstract = {The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level byte-code to detect potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the Souffl{\'{e}} language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95{\%} of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools-Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle-under equivalent conditions .},

abstract = {his paper describes a compositional shape analysis, where each procedure is analyzed independently of its callers. The analysis uses an abstract domain based on a restricted fragment of separation logic, and assigns a collection of Hoare triples to each procedure; the triples provide an over-approximation of data structure usage. Compositionality brings its usual benefits -- increased potential to scale, ability to deal with unknown calling contexts, graceful way to deal with imprecision -- to shape analysis, for the first time. The analysis rests on a generalized form of abduction (inference of explanatory hypotheses) which we call bi-abduction. Bi-abduction displays abduction as a kind of inverse to the frame problem: it jointly infers anti-frames (missing portions of state) and frames (portions of state not touched by an operation), and is the basis of a new interprocedural analysis algorithm. We have implemented our analysis algorithm and we report case studies on smaller programs to evaluate the quality of discovered specifications, and larger programs (e.g., an entire Linux distribution) to test scalability and graceful imprecision.},

abstract = {Payment channels emerged recently as an efficient method for performing cheap micro-payment transactions in cryptographic currencies. In contrast to the traditional on-chain transactions, payment channels have the advantage that they allow nearly unlimited number of transactions between parties without involving the blockchain. In this work, we introduce Perun, a new system for payment and state channels over cryptographic currencies, that has several advantages over the existing propos-als. In particular, Perun offers a new method for connecting channels that is more efficient than the existing technique of " routing transactions " over multiple channels. That is, in contrast to prominent existing solutions such as the Lightning Network, Perun does not require involvement of the interme-diary over which payments are routed. To achieve this, Perun introduces a new technique that we call channel virtualization, which allows to build virtual payment channels over so-called multistate channels. Multistate channels are a new primitive that we introduce as an independent concept in this work and generalizes the notion of " state channels " . Our schemes can work over any cryptocurrency that provides Turing-complete smart contracts. As a proof of concept, we implemented Perun in Ethereum.},

@article{Sompolinsky2017,
abstract = {A growing body of research on Bitcoin and other permissionless cryptocurrencies that utilize Nakamoto's blockchain has shown that they do not easily scale to process a high throughput of transactions, or to quickly approve individual transactions; blocks must be kept small, and their creation rates must be kept low in order to allow nodes to reach consensus securely. As of today, Bitcoin processes a mere 3-7 transactions per second, and transaction confirmation takes at least several minutes. We present SPECTRE, a new protocol for the consensus core of crypto-currencies that remains secure even under high throughput and fast confirmation times. At any throughput, SPECTRE is resilient to attackers with up to 50{\%} of the computational power (up until the limit defined by network congestion and bandwidth constraints). SPECTRE can operate at high block creation rates, which implies that its transactions confirm in mere seconds (limited mostly by the round-trip-time in the network). Key to SPECTRE's achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes. In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system. Our framework formalizes this weaker set of requirements for a crypto-currency's distributed ledger. We then provide a formal proof that SPECTRE satisfies these requirements.},

abstract = {In joint work with Peter O'Hearn and others, based on early ideas of Burstall, we have developed an extension of Hoare logic that permits reasoning about low-level imperative programs that use shared mutable data structure. The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a "separating conjunction" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related "separating implication". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing. In this paper, we survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures. We also discuss promising future directions.},

abstract = {The digital economy is based on data sharing yet citizens have lit- tle control about how their personal data is being used. While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices ac- cessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can im- prove fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to nego- tiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, con- tacts, etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously ne- gotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to suc- cessful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a cryptocurrency framework that uses blockchain technology to provide an open distributed computing plat-form, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM programs are written in bytecode which operates on a sim-ple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like lan-guage called Solidity that compiles to bytecode. Since the main application of EVM programs is as smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets, security is of paramount importance. However, writing trustworthy smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to the intricate semantics of EVM and its openness: both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs. This problem is best illustrated by the recent attack on TheDAO contract, which allowed roughly {\$}50M USD worth of Ether to be transferred into the control of an attacker. Re-covering the funds required a hard fork of the blockchain, contrary to the code is law premise of the system. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Solidity contracts in F , a functional programming language aimed at program verification.},

abstract = {Virtual machines (VMs) are commonly used to distribute programs in an architecture-neutral format, which can easily be interpreted or compiled. A long-running question in the design of VMs is whether stack architecture or register architecture can be implemented more efficiently with an interpreter. We extend existing work on comparing virtual stack and virtual register architectures in two ways. Firstly, our translation from stack to register code is much more sophisticated. The result is that we eliminate an average of more than 47{\%} of executed VM instructions, with the register machine bytecode size only 25{\%} larger than that of the corresponding stack bytecode. Secondly we present an implementation of a register machine in a fully standard-compliant implementation of the Java VM. We find that, on the Pentium 4, the register architecture requires an average of 32.3{\%} less time to execute standard benchmarks if dispatch is performed using a C switch statement. Even if more efficient threaded dispatch is available (which requires labels as first class values), the reduction in running time is still approximately 26.5{\%} for the register architecture.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new replication algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. We believe that Byzantine-fault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior. Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that our service is only 3{\%} slower than a standard unreplicated NFS.},

abstract = {An authenticated data structure (ADS) is a data structure whose operations can be carried out by an untrusted prover, the results of which a verifier can efficiently check as authentic. This is done by having the prover produce a compact proof that the verifier can check along with each operation's result. ADSs thus support outsourcing data maintenance and processing tasks to untrusted servers without loss of integrity. Past work on ADSs has focused on particular data structures (or limited classes of data structures), one at a time, often with support only for particular operations. This paper presents a generic method, using a simple extension to a ML-like functional programming language we call $\lambda$• (lambda-auth), with which one can program authenticated operations over any data structure defined by standard type constructors, including recursive types, sums, and products. The programmer writes the data structure largely as usual and it is compiled to code to be run by the prover and verifier. Using a formalization of $\lambda$• we prove that all well-typed $\lambda$• programs result in code that is secure under the standard cryptographic assumption of collision-resistant hash functions. We have implemented $\lambda$• as an extension to the OCaml compiler, and have used it to produce authenticated versions of many interesting data structures including binary search trees, red-black+ trees, skip lists, and more. Performance experiments show that our approach is efficient, giving up little compared to the hand-optimized data structures developed previously.},

We define the notion of Effectively Callback Free (ECF) objects in order to allow callbacks without preventing modular reasoning. An object is ECF in a given execution trace if there exists an equivalent execution trace without callbacks to this object. An object is ECF if it is ECF in every possible execution trace. We study the decidability of dynamically checking ECF in a given execution trace and statically checking if an object is ECF. We also show that dynamically checking ECF in Ethereum is feasible and can be done online. By running the history of all execution traces in Ethereum, we were able to verify that virtually all existing contracts, excluding the DAO or contracts with similar known vulnerabilities, are ECF. Finally, we show that ECF, whether it is verified dynamically or statically, enables modular reasoning about objects with encapsulated state.},

However, it is proving to be much more than a way to transfer monetary value. At its core, blockchain technology is a way to transfer any kind of information in a fast, tracked, and secure way. The technology is only in the early stages of development and it is hard to recognize its full potential at this formative stage. However, developers are beginning to explore blockchain solutions outside of financial services. These new applications include property transfers, the execution of contracts, authentication services, network and device management, and records management. Despite their novelty, blockchain applications are gaining mainstream traction. Major banks, such as Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, and government entities, such as the U.K. and Estonian governments and Australia Post, are experimenting with how blockchain technology can help them keep better records and provide services that are more efficient.

abstract = {We present a declarative language for compositional specification of contracts governing the exchange of resources. It extends Eber and Peyton Jones's declarative language for specifying financial contracts (Jones et al. in The Fun of Programming. 2003) to the exchange of money, goods and services amongst multiple parties and complements McCarthy's Resources, Events and Agents (REA) accounting model (McCarthy in Account Rev. LVII(3), 554-578, 1982) with a view- independent formal contract model that supports definition of user-defined contracts, automatic monitoring under execution and user-definable analysis of their state before, during and after execution. We provide several realistic examples of commercial contracts and their analyses. A variety of (real) contracts can be expressed in such a fashion as to support their integration, management and analysis in an operational environment that registers events. The language design is driven by both domain considerations and semantic language design methods: a contract denotes a set of traces of events, each of which is an alternative way of concluding the contract successfully, which gives rise to a CSP-style (Brooker et al. in J.ACM 31(3), 560-599, 1984; Hoare in Communicating Sequential Processes, 1985) denotational semantics. The denotational semantics drives the development of a sound and complete small-step operational semantics, where a partially executed contract is represented as a (full) contract that represents the remaining contractual commitments. This operational semantics is then systematically refined in two stages to an instrumented operational semantics that reflects the bookkeeping practice of identifying the specific contractual commitment a particular event matches at the time the event occurs, as opposed to delaying this matching until the contract is concluded.

In this paper we propose a new system, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, which enables strong consistency. Our system, PeerCensus, acts as a certification authority, manages peer identities in a peer-to-peer network, and ultimately enhances Bitcoin and similar systems with strong consistency. Our extensive analysis shows that PeerCensus is in a secure state with high probability. We also show how Discoin, a Bitcoin variant that decouples block creation and transaction confirmation, can be built on top of PeerCensus, enabling real-time payments. Unlike Bitcoin, once transactions in Discoin are committed, they stay committed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a deductive approach to synthesizing imperative programs with pointers from declarative specifications expressed in Separation Logic. Our synthesis algorithm takes as input a pair of assertions---a pre- and a postcondition---which describe two states of the symbolic heap, and derives a program that transforms one state into the other, guided by the shape of the heap. The program synthesis algorithm rests on the novel framework of Synthetic Separation Logic (SSL), which generalises the classical notion of heap entailment {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}P{\}} \backslashvdash \backslashmathcal{\{}Q{\}}{\$} to incorporate a possibility of transforming a heap satisfying an assertion {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$} into a heap satisfying an assertion {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}Q{\}}{\$}. A synthesized program represents a proof term for a transforming entailment statement {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}P{\}} \backslashleadsto \backslashmathcal{\{}Q{\}}{\$}, and the synthesis procedure corresponds to a proof search. The derived programs are, thus, correct by construction, in the sense that they satisfy the ascribed pre/postconditions, and are accompanied by complete proof derivations, which can be checked independently. We have implemented a proof search engine for SSL in a form the program synthesizer called SuSLik. For efficiency, the engine exploits properties of SSL rules, such as invertibility and commutativity of rule applications on separate heaps, to prune the space of derivations it has to consider. We explain and showcase the use of SSL on characteristic examples, describe the design of SuSLik, and report on our experience of using it to synthesize a series of benchmark programs manipulating heap-based linked data structures.},

abstract = {In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, reputation aggregation and ranking are the most time-consuming and space-demanding operations. This paper proposes a new gossip protocol for fast score aggregation. We developed a Bloom filter architecture for efficient score ranking. These techniques do not require any secure hashing or fast lookup mechanism, thus are applicable to both unstructured and structured P2P networks. We report the design principles and performance results of a simulated GossipTrust reputation system. Randomized gossiping with effective use of power nodes enables light-weight aggregation and fast dissemination of global scores in O(log{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} n) time steps, where n is the P2P network size. The Gossip-based protocol is designed to tolerate dynamic peer joining and departure, as well as to avoid possible peer collusions. The scheme has a considerably low gossiping message overhead, i.e. O(n log{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} n) messages for n nodes. Bloom filters demand at most 512 KB memory per node for a 10,000-node network. We evaluate the performance of GossipTrust with distributed P2P file-sharing and parameter-sweeping applications. The simulation results demonstrate that GossipTrust has small aggregation time, low memory demand, and high ranking accuracy. These results suggest promising advantages of using the GossipTrust system for trusted P2P applications.},

@article{Jones2013,
abstract = {This paper reviews recent theoretical and empirical research on high-frequency trading (HFT).   Economic theory identifies several ways that HFT could affect liquidity.  The main positive is that HFT can intermediate trades at lower cost.  However, HFT speed could disadvantage other investors, and the resulting adverse selection could reduce market quality.  Over the past decade, HFT has increased sharply, and liquidity has steadily improved.  But correlation is not necessarily causation.  Empirically, the challenge is to measure the incremental effect of HFT beyond other changes in equity markets.  The best papers for this purpose isolate market structure changes that facilitate HFT.  Virtually every time a market structure change results in more HFT, liquidity and market quality have improved because liquidity suppliers are better able to adjust their quotes in response to new information.  Does HFT make markets more fragile?  In the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash, for example, HFT initially stabilized prices but were eventually overwhelmed, and in liquidating their positions, HFT exacerbated the downturn.  This appears to be a generic feature of equity markets:  similar events have occurred in manual markets, even with affirmative market-maker obligations. Well-crafted individual stock price limits and trading halts have been introduced since.  Similarly, kill switches are a sensible response to the Knight trading episode.  Many of the regulatory issues associated with HFT are the same issues that arose in more manual markets.  Now regulators in the US are appropriately relying on competition to minimize abuses.  Other regulation is appropriate if there are market failures.  For instance, consolidated order-level audit trails are key to robust enforcement.  If excessive messages impose negative externalities on others, fees are appropriate.  But a message tax may act like a transaction tax, reducing share prices, increasing volatility, and worsening liquidity.  Minimum order exposure times would also severely discourage liquidity provision.},

We investigate the approach from the point of view of the logic BI of bunched implications of O'Hearnand Pym. We begin by giving a model in which the law of the excluded middleholds, thus showing that the approach is compatible with classical logic. The relationship between the intuitionistic and classical versions of the system is established by a translation, analogous to a translation from intuitionistic logic into the modal logic S4. We also consider the question of completeness of the axioms. BI's spatial implication is used to express weakest preconditions for object-component assignments, and an axiom for allocating a cons cell is shown to be complete under an interpretation of triplesthat allows a command to be applied to states with dangling pointers. We make this latter a feature, by incorporating an operation, and axiom, for disposing of memory. Finally, we describe a local character enjoyed by specifications in the logic, and show how this enables a class of frame axioms, which say what parts of the heap don't change, to be inferred automatically.},

Trades are executed by a system of Ethereum smart contracts that are publicly acces-sible, free to use and that any dApp can hook into. DApps built on top of the protocol can access public liquidity pools or create their own liquidity pool and charge transaction fees on the resulting volume. The protocol is unopinionated: it does not impose costs on its users or arbitrarily extract value from one group of users to benefit another.

And if so, would that be a good thing? This article under- takes a critical deconstruction of Bitcoin and the blockchain, their themes of democracy and transparency, and the idea that they are trustless. The article then proposes a new conceptualization of the role of trust in busi- ness and contracting: the bridging model, which allows for a more nu- anced understanding of the interplay between enforcement and trust in contract formation. The bridging model is applied first to traditional bank- ing, to illustrate and analyze the enforcement mechanisms underpinning the U.S. dollar as currency and the banking system as a whole, and to demonstrate that the enforcement mechanisms (government backing and regulation) are not as robust as generally believed. The bridging model is then applied to Bitcoin, to show not only that the system requires more trust than is generally understood, but also that both currency and payment systems benefit from the involvement of trusted intermediaries in response to problems and crises.},

@article{Bonneau2015,
abstract = {Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful crypto-graphic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promis-ing alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifica-tions, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison. I. WHY BITCOIN IS WORTHY OF RESEARCH Consider two opposing viewpoints on Bitcoin in straw-man form. The first is that " Bitcoin works in practice, but not in theory. " At times devoted members of the Bitcoin community espouse this philosophy and criticize the security research community for failing to discover Bitcoin, not im-mediately recognizing its novelty, and still today dismissing it due to the lack of a rigorous theoretical foundation. A second viewpoint is that Bitcoin's stability relies on an unknown combination of socioeconomic factors which is hopelessly intractable to model with sufficient precision, failing to yield a convincing argument for the system's soundness. Given these difficulties, experienced security re-searchers may avoid Bitcoin as a topic of study, considering it prudent security engineering to only design systems with precise threat models that admit formal security proofs. We intend to show where each of these simplistic view-points fail. To the first, we contend that while Bitcoin has worked surprisingly well in practice so far, there is an im-portant role for research to play in identifying precisely why this has been possible, moving beyond a blind acceptance of the informal arguments presented with the system's initial proposal. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand whether Bitcoin will still " work in practice " as practices change. We expect external political and economic factors to evolve, the system must change if and when transaction volume scales, and the nature of the monetary rewards for Bitcoin miners will change over time as part of the system design. It is not enough to argue that Bitcoin has worked from 2009– 2014 and will therefore continue likewise. We do not yet have sufficient understanding to conclude with confidence that Bitcoin will continue to work well in practice, which is a crucial research challenge that requires insight from computer science theory. To the second viewpoint, we contend that Bitcoin is filling an important niche by providing a virtual currency system without any trusted parties and without pre-assumed identities among the participants. Within these constraints, the general problem of consensus in a distributed system is impossible [7], [93] without further assumptions like Bitcoin's premise that rational (greedy) behavior can be modeled and incentives can be aligned to ensure secure operation of the consensus algorithm. Yet these constraints matter in practice, both philosophically and technically, and Bitcoin's approach to consensus within this model is deeply surprising and a fundamental contribution. Bitcoin's core consensus protocol also has profound implications for many other computer security problems beyond currency 1 such as distributed naming, secure timestamping and commitment, generation of public randomness, as well as many finan-cial problems such as self-enforcing (" smart ") contracts, decentralized markets and order books, and distributed au-tonomous agents. In short, even though Bitcoin is not easy to model, it is worthy of considerable research attention as it may form the basis for practical solutions to exceedingly difficult and important problems. With this dichotomy in mind, we set out to synthesize the collective knowledge from the first six years of Bitcoin's operation and development, as well as from its many derived cryptocurrencies. Our goal is both to highlight the many areas where significant innovation has already occurred, ranging from novel payment protocols to user-friendly key management, and also highlight the most important open research challenges for Bitcoin and future cryptocurrencies.},

We have seen the impact on businesses that adapt and those which don't. For example, the technical revolution hit the taxi industry when mobile app technology allowed people with a vehicle and free time to offer taxi services. Technical disruption is also changing the car industry as IT visionaries have set out to develop cars that can self-park and self-drive using electrical engines and tablet technology. Companies that shy away from technological changes and do not adapt to the new digital environment risk falling by the wayside. The financial industry is also experiencing these changes and financial companies are looking at new technologies as they emerge and deciding whether or not to embrace them and the new opportunities they provide.},

abstract = {Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract development platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering a variety of application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, and so on. Given their financial nature, the security of these contracts is of paramount importance, as exemplified by recent attacks exploiting programming mistakes to freeze or steal millions of dollars (e.g., the DAO and Parity attacks). An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but it is challenging due to the EVM bytecode format in which contracts are uploaded on the blockchain, which exposes very little static information, and due to the specific transaction-oriented programming mechanisms, which feature a subtle semantics. In this work, we present the first sound and automated static analysis for EVM bytecode, which is practical and scales to large contracts. In particular, our static analysis supports reachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing the most important security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy and transaction environment dependency). The soundness of our analysis is proven against a complete and mechanized semantics of EVM bytecode. We implemented our analysis and tested our tool-EtherTrust-on real-world contracts from the Ethereum blockchain, comparing it with Oyente, the state-of-the-art bug finding tool for smart contracts: EtherTrust analyses real-life contracts in a few seconds, outperforming Oyente in efficiency and coverage by one order of magnitude. Furthermore, EtherTrust shows better precision on a benchmark, all of that despite being the first tool in the literature to provide formal security guarantees for EVM bytecode.},

We implemented MAIAN, the first tool for precisely specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs inter-procedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34,200 (2,365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract.

Contingency contracts address this, but are often impractical. As an alternative, we propose leveled commitment contracts. The level of commitment is set by breach penalties. To be freed from the contract, an agent simply pays the penalty to the other party. A self-interested agent will be reluctant to breach because the other party might breach, in which case the former agent is freed from the contract, does not incur a penalty, and collects a penalty from the breacher. We show that, despite such strategic breach, leveled commitment increases the expected payoff to both contract parties and can enable deals that are impossible under full commitment. Asymmetric beliefs are also discussed. Different decommitting mechanisms are introduced and compared. Practical prescriptions for market designers are provided.

Given this complexity, these components, and the ensuing system, are increasingly being conceptualised, designed, and built using agent-based techniques and, to this end, this paper examines the specific role of trust in multi-agent systems. In particular, we survey the state of the art and provide an account of the main directions along which research efforts are being focused. In so doing, we critically evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the main models that have been proposed and show how, fundamentally, they all seek to minimise the uncertainty in interactions. Finally, we outline the areas that require further research in order to develop a comprehensive treatment of trust in complex computational settings.},

abstract = {The internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with decentralized open ones; trusted parties replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location addresses replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algo-rithmic markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decen-tralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars. These systems are the first instances of internet-wide Open Services, where participants form a decentralized network providing useful services for pay, with no central management or trusted parties. IPFS has proven the utility of content-addressing by decentralizing the web itself, serving billions of files used across a global peer-to-peer network. It lib-erates data from silos, survives network partitions, works offline, routes around censorship, and gives permanence to digital information. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called " Filecoin "), which miners earn by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incen-tive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat models. The protocol's cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive layer on top of IPFS [1], which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts. This work: (a) Introduces the Filecoin Network, gives an overview of the protocol, and walks through several components in detail. (b) Formalizes decentralized storage network (DSN) schemes and their properties, then constructs File-coin as a DSN. (c) Introduces a novel class of proof-of-storage schemes called proof-of-replication, which allows proving that any replica of data is stored in physically independent storage. (d) Introduces a novel useful-work consensus based on sequential proofs-of-replication and storage as a measure of power. (e) Formalizes verifiable markets and constructs two markets, a Storage Market and a Retrieval Market, which govern how data is written to and read from Filecoin, respectively. (f) Discusses use cases, connections to other systems, and how to use the protocol.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has increasing attention in research and across many industries. The Ethereum blockchain offers smart contracts, which are small programs defined, executed, and recorded as transactions in the blockchain transaction history. These smart contracts run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can be used to encode agreements, trans-fer assets, and enforce integrity conditions in relationships between parties. Smart contracts can carry financial value, and are increasingly used for safety-, security-, or mission-critical purposes. Errors in smart contracts have led and will lead to loss or harm. Formal verification can provide the highest level of confidence about the correct behaviour of smart contracts. In this paper we extend an existing EVM formalisation in Isabelle/HOL by a sound program logic at the level of bytecode. We structure bytecode sequences into blocks of straight-line code and create a program logic to reason about these. This abstraction is a step towards con-trol of the cost and complexity of formal verification of EVM smart contracts.},

abstract = {The principal problem in algorithmic mechanism design is in merging the incentive constraints imposed by selfish behavior with the algorithmic constraints imposed by computational intractability. This field is motivated by the observation that the preeminent approach for designing incentive compatible mechanisms, namely that of Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves; and the central approach for circumventing computational obstacles, that of approximation algorithms, are fundamentally incompatible: natural applications of the VCG approach to an approximation algorithm fails to yield an incentive compatible mechanism. We consider relaxing the desideratum of (ex post) incentive compatibility (IC) to Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC), where truthtelling is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium (the standard notion of incentive compatibility in economics). For welfare maximization in single-parameter agent settings, we give a general black-box reduction that turns any approximation algorithm into a Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism with essentially the same approximation factor.},

@incollection{Hirai2017,
abstract = {Motivation. Public ledger is a decentralized book keeping technology and is believed to have the potential to revolutionize many areas. Besides handling crypto-currency, public ledger can be used to tokenize arbitrary assets, and then support trading of these asset tokens in a decentralized manner. With public ledger based token trading system, users do not necessarily convert their assets to currencies, but can exchange assets directly. It also avoids unnecessary transportation as the asset only needs to be physically transferred to its last owner. Furthermore, utilization of the public ledger does not require that users have to trust each other in order to trade tokens safely. However, using decentralized public ledger for trading asset tokens raises serious privacy concerns. Because token ownership information is stored on the public ledger and disclosed to the public, anyone can uncover users trading activities and history. For a token based asset trading platform, all tokens are unique and transactions are usually two-ways or multi-ways. In response to these challenges, we propose ZeroTrade, a privacy respecting heterogeneous assets trading system that leverages various cryptography tools to conceal the exchange trace of asset tokens and takes advantage of public ledger for guaranteeing fairness of asset token exchange. Solution. ZeroTrade involves trusted hubs that are responsible for converting assets to tokens and back, where trusted means that hubs will generate/accept valid tokens, and uses the public ledger to record all token exchange information. When two or more users want to exchange tokens with each other, each user picks an agent for the exchange. Asset tokens are first poured into a pool and users leverage agents to obliviously retrieve tokens from the pool in order to finish the exchange. The oblivious retrieving process cut off the connection between the original user and the agent. Therefore, one cannot determine the relationship between the original users who want to exchange tokens by observing information recorded on the public ledger. To implement the design, ZeroTrade leverages different cryptography tools including zero-knowledge proof and various encryption techniques. Considering various demands in token trade, ZeroTrade also supports operations like partial token trade and revocation. A preliminary evaluation of the performance shows that ZeroTrade only adds limited burden on top of the public ledger. More detailed information can be found in the full version of the paper. Conclusion. ZeroTrade provides a privacy friendly platform for asset trading based on public ledger. For the next step, we plan to implement a fully functional prototype and considering more complex token trading scenarios. {\textcopyright} International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.},

While BitTorrent has been ex- tremely successful, we show that its incentive mecha- nism is not robust to strategic clients. Through perfor- mance modeling parameterized by real world traces, we demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do not directly improve their performance. We use these re- sults to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant, a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70{\%} performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet swarms. We further show that when applied universally, strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance compared to today's BitTorrent client implementations.},

abstract = {Automated negotiation systems with software agents representing individuals or organizations and capable of reaching agreements through negotiation are becoming increasingly important and pervasive. Examples, to mention a few, include the industrial trend toward agent-based supply chain management, the business trend toward virtual enterprises, and the pivotal role that electronic commerce is increasingly assuming in many organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have paid a great deal of attention to automated negotiation over the past decade and a number of prominent models have been proposed in the literature. These models exhibit fairly different features, make use of a diverse range of concepts, and show performance characteristics that vary significantly depending on the negotiation context. As a consequence, assessing and relating individual research contributions is a difficult task. Currently, there is a need to build a framework to define and characterize the essential features that are necessary to conduct automated negotiation and to compare the usage of key concepts in different publications. Furthermore, the development of such a framework can be an important step to identify the core elements of autonomous negotiating agents, to provide a coherent set of concepts related to automated negotiation, to assess progress in the field, and to highlight new research directions. Accordingly, this paper introduces a generic framework for automated negotiation. It describes, in detail, the components of the framework, assesses the sophistication of the majority of work in the AI literature on these components, and discusses a number of prominent models of negotiation. This paper also highlights some of the major challenges for future automated negotiation research.},

abstract = {Program code stored on the Ethereum blockchain is consid- ered immutable, but this does not imply that its control flow cannot be modified. This bears the risk of loopholes whenever parties encode binding agreements in smart contracts. In order to quantify the issue, we define a heuristic indicator of control flow immutability, evaluate it based on a call graph of all smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, and find that two out of five smart contracts require trust in at least one third party. Besides, the analysis reveals that significant parts of the Ethereum blockchain are interspersed with debris from past attacks against the platform. We leverage the call graph to develop a method for data cleanup, which allows for less biased statistics of Ethereum use in practice. Keywords:},

abstract = {While showing great promise, Bitcoin requires users to wait tens of minutes for transactions to commit, and even then, offering only probabilistic guarantees. This paper introduces ByzCoin, a novel Byzantine consensus protocol that leverages scalable collective signing to commit Bitcoin transactions irreversibly within seconds. ByzCoin achieves Byzantine consensus while preserving Bitcoin's open membership by dynamically forming hash power-proportionate consensus groups that represent recently-successful block miners. ByzCoin employs communication trees to optimize transaction commitment and verification under normal operation while guaranteeing safety and liveness under Byzantine faults, up to a near-optimal tolerance of f faulty group members among 3f + 2 total. ByzCoin mitigates double spending and selfish mining attacks by producing collectively signed transaction blocks within one minute of transaction submission. Tree-structured communication further reduces this latency to less than 30 seconds. Due to these optimizations, ByzCoin achieves a throughput higher than PayPal currently handles, with a confirmation latency of 15-20 seconds.},

abstract = {We present a language-independent verification framework that can be instantiated with an operational semantics to automatically generate a program verifier. The framework treats both the operational semantics and the program correctness specifications as reachability rules between matching logic patterns, and uses the sound and relatively complete reachability logic proof system to prove the specifications using the semantics. We instantiate the framework with the semantics of one academic language, KernelC, as well as with three recent semantics of real-world languages, C, Java, and JavaScript, developed independently of our verification infrastructure. We evaluate our approach empirically and show that the generated program verifiers can check automatically the full functional correctness of challenging heap-manipulating programs implementing operations on list and tree data structures, like AVL trees. This is the first approach that can turn the operational semantics of real-world languages into correct-by-construction automatic verifiers.},

These are called faster payments settlement systems. Traditionally, retail payments$\backslash$nhave made extensive use of interbank netting systems, in which payments are accumulated for end-of-day$\backslash$nsettlement. This approach, known as deferred net settlement (DNS), reduces the liquidity needs of the$\backslash$npayment system, but bears inherent operational and financial risks for unsettled intraday payments. As$\backslash$nlarge dollar volumes of retail payments accumulate, real-time gross settlement (RTGS) has been recognized$\backslash$nas an attractive option, especially for high-value payments.

This$\backslash$nresearch proposes a hybrid faster payments settlement system involving elements of both DNS and RTGS.$\backslash$nWe explore a mechanism that supports centralized queuing, permits payment prioritization, reduces payment$\backslash$ndelays, enhances liquidity, and optimizes the settlement process. We offer a modeling framework$\backslash$nand experimental simulations to evaluate the proposed approach. Our evaluation is based on a set of system$\backslash$nperformance conjectures that support operational performance evaluation and mechanism design-related$\backslash$npolicy insights. Our results point out the qualities of a cost-effective and value-maximizing mechanism$\backslash$nto quickly settle increasingly large volumes of retail payments, while ensuring that the incentives for$\backslash$npayment system stakeholders are given careful consideration.},

abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program's authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the last four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.

The analysis of trust is based on four questions: whether scholars can agree on the meaning of trust; if researchers are viewing trust statistically; if the status of trust--cause, effect, or interaction--changes across disciplines; and whether the levels of analysis also change. The "bandwidth" of trust--where trust and distrust are differentiated--can vary over time in the same relationship or coexist at the same time. Bandwidth types are deterrence-based trust, calculus-based trust, relational trust, and institution-based trust. Two conditions of trust are risk and interdependence. Three phases are building, stability, and dissolution. Several studies are mentioned.},

Since no central authorities may exist, the only way agents can find trustworthy correspondents is by collaborating with others to identify those whose past behavior has been untrustworthy. In other words, finding trustworthy correspondents reduces to the problem of distributed reputation management.Our approach adapts the mathematical theory of evidence to represent and propagate the ratings that agents give to their correspondents. When evaluating the trustworthiness of a correspondent, an agent combines its local evidence (based on direct prior interactions with the correspondent) with the testimonies of other agents regarding the same correspondent. We experimentally studied this approach to establish that some important properties of trust are captured by it.},

Rather than competing within the confines of the existing industry or trying to steal customers from rivals, Cirque developed uncontested market space that made the competition irrelevant. Cirque created what the authors call a blue ocean, a previously unknown market space. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In red oceans-that is, in all the industries already existing-companies compete by grabbing for a greater share of limited demand. As the market space gets more crowded, prospects for profits and growth decline. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody. There are two ways to create blue oceans. One is to launch completely new industries, as eBay did with online auctions. But it's much more common for a blue ocean to be created from within a red ocean when a company expands the boundaries of an existing industry. In studying more than 150 blue ocean creations in over 30 industries, the authors observed that the traditional units of strategic analysis-company and industry-are of limited use in explaining how and why blue oceans are created. The most appropriate unit of analysis is the strategic move, the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering. Creating blue oceans builds brands. So powerful is blue ocean strategy, in fact, that a blue ocean strategic move can create brand equity that lasts for decades.},

abstract = {I thank the ACM for this award. I can't help but feel that I am receiving this honor for timing and serendip- ity as much as technical merit. UNIX1 swept into popu- larity with an industry-wide change from central main- frames to autonomous minis. I suspect that Daniel Bob- row [1] would be here instead of me if he could not afford a PDP-10 and had had to "settle" for a PDP-11. Moreover, the current state of UNIX is the result of the labors of a large number of people. There is an old adage, "Dance with the one that brought you," which means that I should talk about UNIX. I have not worked on mainstream UNIX in many years, yet I continue to get undeserved credit for the work of others. Therefore, I am not going to talk about UNIX, but I want to thank everyone who has contrib- uted. That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty. In the ten years that we have worked together, I can recall only one case of miscoordination of work. On that occasion, I discovered that we both had written the same 20-line assembly language program. I compared the sources and was as- tounded to find that they matched character-for-char- acter. The result of our work together has been far greater than the work that we each contributed. I am a programmer. On my 1040 form, that is what I put down as my occupation. As a programmer, I write programs. I would like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote. I will do this in three stages and try to bring it together at the end.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a solution to consistency problems in peer to peer networks. By now, it has matured as a solution to a range of use cases in which it can effectively provide the notion of third party trust without the need for a trusted (physical) third party, which makes it an attractive coordination mechanism for distributed systems. To promote the wide adoption of this technology, we yet lack mechanisms that make the specification and interpretation of smart contracts accessible to a broader audience. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that supports the semi-automated translation of human-readable contract representations into computational equivalents in order to enable the codification of laws into verifi- able and enforceable computational structures that reside within a public blockchain. We identify smart contract components that correspond to real world institutions, and propose a mapping that we operationalize using a domain-specific language in order to support the contract modeling process.We explore this capability based on selected examples and plot out directions for future research on smart contracts.

This paper presents EthIR, a framework for analyzing Ethereum bytecode, which relies on (an extension of) OYENTE, a tool that generates CFGs; EthIR produces from the CFGs, a rule-based representation (RBR) of the bytecode that enables the application of (existing) high-level analyses to infer properties of EVM code.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges that hinder further adaption of decentralized cryptocurrencies is scalability. Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger – the so-called blockchain – transaction throughput is inherently limited. An im-portant proposal to significantly improve scalability are off-chain protocols, where the massive amount of transactions is executed without requiring the costly interaction with the blockchain. Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support carrying out off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbi-trary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and develop secu-rity proofs showing that our construction satisfies security against powerful adversaries. An additional benefit of our construction over most existing payment networks is the use of channel virtualization, which further reduces latency and costs in complex channel networks.},

We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far.

Further, a key challenge for multiagent systems is how to determine trust based on reports from multiple sources, who might themselves be trusted to varying degrees. Hence an ability to combine evidence-based trust reports in a manner that dis- counts for imperfect trust in the reporting agents is crucial formultiagent systems. This paper understands trust in terms of belief and certainty: A's trust in B is reflected in the strength of A's belief that B is trustworthy. This paper for- mulates certainty in terms of evidence based on a statistical measure defined over a probability dis- tribution of the probability of positive outcomes. This novel definition supports important mathemat- ical properties, including (1) certainty increases as conflict increases provided the amount of evidence is unchanged, and (2) certainty increases as the amount of evidence increases provided conflict is unchanged. Moreover, despite a more subtle defi- nition than previous approaches, this paper (3) es- tablishes a bijection between evidence and trust spaces, enabling robust combination of trust reports and (4) provides an efficient algorithmfor comput- ing this bijection.},

Previously, it was argued that existing systems may suffer from vulnerabilities that permit effective, profitable cheating despite the use of the system. In this work, we experimentally substantiate the presence of these vulnerabilities by successfully implementing and testing a number of such attacks, which consist only of sequences of sales (honest and dishonest) that can be executed in the system. This investigation also reveals two new, previously-unnoted cheating techniques. Our success in executing these attacks compellingly makes a key point: security must be a central design goal for developers of trust and reputation systems.},

We also define a model of a network, implementing the pro-tocol in the form of a replicated state-transition system. The protocol's executions are modeled via a small-step operational semantics for asynchronous message passing, in which packages can be rearranged or duplicated. In this work, we focus on the notion of global system safety, proving a form of eventual consistency. To do so, we provide a library of theorems about a pure functional implementation of block forests, define an inductive sys-tem invariant, and show that, in a quiescent system state, it implies a global agreement on the state of per-node transaction ledgers. Our development is parametric wrt. implementations of several security primitives, such as hash-functions, a notion of a proof object, a Validator Acceptance Function, and a Fork Choice Rule.

Although informative, the semantic definition proposed for the most standard ACL (FIPA 1997) is complicated and contentious, while published IPs tend to be ambiguous, incomplete, and unverified with respect to message semantics. As a case study to clarify and help rectify these problems, we have investigated verification of the contract net protocol when its messages are presumed to be expressed in FIPA ACL. In order to help both informal comprehension and formal verification we separate several concerns. We suggest a revised and simpler core semantics for many of the FIPA ACL speech acts, using the same belief-intention style of logic, although the underlying ideas are not dependent on this detail. An extended form of propositional dynamic logic and statecharts is used to express IPs. States are interpreted using mutual beliefs and intention, and properties such as termination and consistency of joint beliefs are shown.},

Solving some of the open problems raised by Chevaleyre et al. (2006) and confirming their conjectures, we prove that egalitarian social welfare optimization is NP-complete for the bundle form, and both exact utilitarian and exact egalitarian social welfare optimization are DP-complete, each for both the bundle and the 2-additive form, where DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP. In addition, we prove that social welfare optimization by the Nash product is NP-complete for both the bundle and the 1-additive form, and that the exact variants are DP-complete for the bundle and the 3-additive form. For utility functions represented as straight-line programs, we show NP-completeness for egalitarian social welfare optimization and social welfare optimization by the Nash product. Finally, we show that social welfare optimization by the Nash product in the 1-additive form is hard to approximate, yet we also give fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for egalitarian and Nash product social welfare optimization in the 1-additive form with a fixed number of agents. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

By taking advantage of the repetition of sections of bytecode among multiple smart contracts previously deployed in the Ethereum blockchain we propose a new pseudo opcode that acts as a pointer that will allow smart contracts to reuse previously deployed code. We show that our proposed algorithm achieves space savings of up to 75{\%} in a dataset of deployed Ethereum smart contracts bytecode, on par with other state of the art compression algorithms while remaining compatible with other methods currently in use for space reduction.},

They enable a censorship-resistant domain-name system outside the control of any single en-tity, among other applications. Namecoin, a fork of Bitcoin, is the most prominent example. We initiate the study of decentralized names-paces and the market for names in such systems. Our extensive empirical analysis of Namecoin re-veals a system in disrepair. Indeed, our methodol-ogy for detecting " squatted " and otherwise inactive domains reveals that among Namecoin's roughly 120,000 registered domain names, a mere 28 are not squatted and have nontrivial content. Further, we develop techniques for detecting transfers of do-mains in the Namecoin block chain and provide evidence that the market for domains is thin-to-nonexistent. We argue that the state of the art in mecha-nism design for decentralized namespace markets is lacking. We propose a model of utility of differ-ent names to different participants, and articulate desiderata of a decentralized namespace in terms of this utility function. We use this model to ex-plore the design space of mechanisms and analyze the trade-offs.},

We give a semantics that captures parameterised, generic multi-agent systems and identify three notable classes that represent different ways in which the agents may interact among themselves and with the environment. While the verification problem is undecidable in general we put forward cutoff procedures for the classes identified. The methodology is based on the existence of a notion of simulation between the templates for the agents and the template for the environment in the system. We show that the cutoff identification procedures as well as the general algorithms that we propose are sound; for one class we show the decidability of the verification problem and present a complete cutoff procedure. We report experimental results obtained on MCMAS-P, a novel model checker implementing the parameterised model checking methodologies here devised.},

In other robotics applications many robust systems already exist for localization such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and LIDAR based SLAM. These approaches either require special hardware or are very computationally expensive and are not suitable for the Nao robot, the current robot of choice for the SPL. Therefore novel approaches to localization in the RoboCup SPL environment are required. In this paper we present a new approach to localization in the SPL which relies primarily on the information contained within white field markings while being efficient enough to run in real time on board a Nao robot. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multi-agent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented (31 Refs.)},

All the existing exchanges are also vulnerable frontrunning attacks. Tesseract overcomes these flaws by using a trusted execution environment, specif-ically Intel SGX. The task of committing the recent trades data to inde-pendent cryptocurrency systems presents an all-or-nothing fairness problem, that can be solved by means of SPV proofs or multiple SGX-enabled servers. Tesseract also mitigates denial-of-service attacks by running a consensus protocol among SGX-enabled servers. Tesseract supports not only real-time cross-chain cryp-tocurrency trading, but also a secure method to tokenize assets pegged to various cryptocurrencies. For instance, Tesseract-tokenized bitcoins can circulate on the Ethereum blockchain for use in smart contracts. We provide a reference implementation of Tesseract that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {We consider the language inclusion problem for timed automata: given two timed automata A and B, are all the timed traces accepted by B also accepted by A? While this problem is known to be undecidable, we show here that it becomes decidable if A is restricted to having at most one clock. This is somewhat surprising, since it is well-known that there exist timed automata with a single clock that cannot be complemented. The crux of our proof consists in reducing the language inclusion problem to a reachability question on an infinite graph; we then construct a suitable well-quasi-order on the nodes of this graph, which ensures the termination of our search algorithm. We also show that the language inclusion problem is decidable if the only constant appearing among the clock constraints of A is zero. Moreover, these two cases are essentially the only decidable instances of language inclusion, in terms of restricting the various resources of timed automata.},

Service-level agreements (SLAs) - contracts between a provider and a customer - are a sine qua non in the deployment of UC. A crucial stage in the life-cycle of contracts (such as SLAs) is their automated performance monitoring while active; a significant aspect of which concerns the tracking of contract state. In this work, we define an ontology to capture aspects of SLAs that are pertinent to the tracking of state for performance monitoring, and generalise these aspects so that the ontology may be applicable to other contract domains. The ontology is formalised as an XML-based language, called CTXML (contract tracking XML). The semantics for CTXML are presented in terms of a computational model based on the event calculus.},

The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.},

abstract = {We present a lightweight approach to Hoare-style specifications for fine-grained concurrency, based on a notion of time-stamped histories that abstractly capture atomic changes in the program state. Our key observation is that histories form a partial commutative monoid, a structure fundamental for representation of concurrent resources. This insight provides us with a unifying mechanism that allows us to treat histories just like heaps in separation logic. For example, both are subject to the same assertion logic and inference rules (e.g., the frame rule). Moreover, the notion of ownership transfer, which usually applies to heaps, has an equivalent in histories. It can be used to formally represent helping---an important design pattern for concurrent algorithms whereby one thread can execute code on behalf of another. Specifications in terms of histories naturally abstract granularity, in the sense that sophisticated fine-grained algorithms can be given the same specifications as their simplified coarse-grained counterparts, making them equally convenient for client-side reasoning. We illustrate our approach on a number of examples and validate all of them in Coq.},

By predicting the sign of the future change in price, we are modeling the price prediction problem as a binomial classification task, experimenting with a custom algorithm that leverages both random forests and generalized linear models.

We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

The objective was to elicit and document views on three research hypotheses about the potential impact of mutual distributed ledger technology ('blockchain') on post-trade processing global securities markets. These hypotheses are (a) on the appropriate access to mutual distributed ledger; (b) on whether change would be piecemeal or 'big bang'; and (c) on the extent to which applying mutual distributed ledger in securities settlement would require major changes in business processes. Our research finds that while the use of blockchain to validate operational data in mutual distributed ledgers can yield substantial reductions in both cost and risk, the concept of data sharing itself is far from new. Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations of the extent to which the technology on its own will address the underlying need for co-ordination of business processes both within and between firms. Achieving all the potential benefits from mutual distributed ledgers will require board level buy-in to a substantial commitment of time and resource, and active regulatory support for process reform, with relatively little short term payoff.},

abstract = {We consider the design and enactment of multi-agent protocols that describe collaboration using " normative " or " social " abstractions, specifically, commitments. A (multiagent) protocol defines the relevant social states and how they progress; each participant maintains a local projection of these states and acts accordingly. Protocols expose two important challenges: (1) how to compose them in a way that respects commitments and (2) how to verify the compliance of the parties with the so-cial states. Individually, these challenges are inad-equately studied and together not at all. We motivate the notion of a social context to cap-ture how a protocol may be enacted. A protocol can be verifiably enacted when its participants can de-termine each other's compliance. We first show the negative result that even when protocols can be ver-ifiably enacted in respective social contexts, their composition cannot be verifiably enacted in the composition of those social contexts. We next show how to expand such a protocol so that it can be verifiably enacted. Our approach involves design rules to specify composite protocols so they would be verifiably enactable. Our approach demonstrates a use of dialectical commitments, which have pre-viously been overlooked in the protocols literature.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of JavaScript and its complex semantics make it a difficult target for logic-based verification. We introduce JaVerT, a semi-automatic JavaScript Verification Toolchain, based on separation logic and aimed at the specialist developer wanting rich, mechanically verified specifications of critical JavaScript code. To specify JavaScript programs, we design abstractions that capture its key heap structures (for example, prototype chains and function closures), allowing the user to write clear and succinct specifications with minimal knowledge of the JavaScript internals. To verify JavaScript programs, we develop JaVerT, a verification pipeline consisting of: JS-2-JSIL, a well-tested compiler from JavaScript to JSIL, an intermediate goto language capturing the fundamental dynamic features of JavaScript; JSIL Verify, a semi-automatic verification tool based on a sound JSIL separation logic; and verified axiomatic specifications of the JavaScript internal functions. Using JaVerT, we verify functional correctness properties of data-structure libraries (key-value map, priority queue) written in object-oriented style; operations on data structures such as binary search trees (BSTs) and lists; examples illustrating function closures; and test cases from the official ECMAScript test suite. The verification times suggest that reasoning about larger, more complex code using JaVerT is feasible.},
