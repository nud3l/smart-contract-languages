\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
An overview of smart contracts and verification methods is presented.
Languages are developed and improved to allow easier verification by defining formal semantics. Also, secure patterns like explicit state transitions and restricted instructions are applied. Verification efforts concentrate on finding known vulnerabilities and formally defining smart contract logic to verify implementations.

We note three areas of future work. Formal semantics are being adopted for low-level languages, and selected IRs have been designed from a formal semantics. However, high-level languages with full formal semantics are just being developed.
Formal semantics on all levels of languages is a requirement to develop verified compilers. Verified compilers and formal semantics can then be used to build automated proof-based verification methods.

% Smart contracts are a new type of programs that have direct access to currency and are executed on a global distributed network.
