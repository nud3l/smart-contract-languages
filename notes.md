# Notes

## Languages

- Plutus: Phil Wadler!
- GitHub page with all the languages (smart programming languages): tikhomirov
- Rholang: pi-calculus (more specific than concurrent)
- contract-oriented -> object-oriented!
- Solidity -> not special from the others!
- check if any language is special
- multi-threading capabilities of languages!
- asynchronous!
- Agoric language
- Axlang -> axony in Manhattan -> smart contracts for big banks, design their own IR, design their own HL, written in Scala
- Add platform! in Table 1
- Add current state of language development -> add date
- How is money represented in the contract? Transfer of money, specific functions calls, all function calls, not sure how it is done, yet
- Three tiers: high-level, IR, low-level
- Language based another language or implemented in?
- stack-based (?) -> operand stack
- Rholang: current status?

- Scilla-checker?
- Organise tools/verification models

- On left hand side: KEVM not K

- Boogie -> IR -> compiles to Z3
- Dafny is written on top of Boogy
- holistic specifications -> paper by Sophia
